That is 14 percent lower than a revised August annual rate of 643 ,000 and 23 percent lower than the September 1979 level of 716 ,000 units . The annual rates are estimated by taking actual sales for a month x multiplying them by 12 and then adjusting for normal seasonal sales patterns .

Sales of larger x fuel inefficient vehicles are down sharply x while smaller American cars have held their own in the domestic market x top officials of Toyota x Nissan and the American International Automobile Dealers Association asserted in testimony before the International Trade Commission here . This Federal tribunal x which adjudicates trade cases x was in the third day of hearings on petitions by the Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers union that allege that serious economic injury was caused by imports from Japan and that quotas that would cut back Japanese shipments by more than 50 percent should be imposed . Biggest Case for Panel In this x by far the biggest trade case ever to come before the trade panel x the five commissioners will have to sift through masses of conflicting statistics x documents x legal briefs and oral testimony before voting on their findings the week of Nov 10 . Should the panel agree with Ford and the UAW . x it would recommend a relief package to President Carter x who would probably then begin negotiating quotas with the Japanese Government . If the commission decides that imports are not cause of injury x the case for protection would be seriously undermined x although Congress x which has expressed concern over the plight of auto workers and the deteriorating financial health of the auto companies x could still ask the President to negotiate a quota agreement with the Japanese . In the first half of 1980 x the importers said today x foreign car sales in the United States increased by 13 ,000 units over the first half of 1979 x or (little) not 1 percent . ''General Motors sells that many cars in a day ,'' said Robert M . McElwaine x president of the International Dealers Association x who noted that during this same period GM's sales of small cars increased by 250 ,000 units . ''While the industry has pointed the finger at imports x GM has quietly and efficiently gobbled up the small car market ,'' Mr McElwaine said . Ford and the UAW . had argued in the two prior days of testimony that x since imports had increased while total car and truck sales were falling x imports had to be pinpointed as the cause of injury . Comparative Figures Presented According to figures presented by Ford's chairman x Philip Caldwell x total car and truck sales of 12 .8 million units in 1978 will drop to 8dot2 million in 1980 x while imports from Japan will have increased by one million units over the same period . Representatives of Toyota and Nissan argued x however x that the problems of the domestic industry were merely temporary x and with the introduction of small x fuel efficient cars x the domestic industry could look forward to a healthy upturn as the economy improved x (without) not aid of any protection . Said Norman D . Lean x senior xvice president of Toyota: ''GM already has the two hottest selling lines in the small car market x the Chevette and the 'X' bodies .

''Picture yourself looking at imported beers in a store ,'' said Manuel Fernandez x president of Moctezuma Imports Inc . x the largest importer of Mexico's Dos Equis beer . ''Where three years ago a store might have stocked 15 brands of imported beers x today it will stock 55 . With so many new beers in the marketplace x Heineken is suffering .'' Leo Van Munching Jr . x president of Van Munching and Company x Heineken's American distributor x acknowledged that sales from wholesalers to retailers x which for the past six years had grown at an annual rate of 30 percent x dropped to 5 percent from October 1979 through last July .

''We reduced our shipments earlier this year to eat up extra inventories ,'' Mr Van Munching said . ''The inventory problem occurred because when we announced the biggest increase in our history of 70 cents per case at the end of 1979 x we gave our distributors a chance to buy at the old prices . We are not delighted with our performance x but it is not unrealistic x given the economy and the necessary period of adjustment to our price increases .'' Mr Van Munching contended that some imports were showing rising sales because of ''extensive trade discounts .'' According to a trade newsletter x Impact x 4dot4 million barrels of beer were imported last year x 2dot5 percent of the 171 .8 million barrels produced for the United States market . 40percent of Import Market Heineken x which has a xshare of the import market estimated at 40 percent x was introduced into the United States in 1933 and is now marketed in every state .

In June x beer shipments from the Netherlands fell to 103 ,000 barrels x from 224 ,000 the year before x a drop of 54 percent .

Non European imports generally cost $1 (less) not per six pack than the European beers .

Labatt's and Molson are both made in Canada . ''We are very happy ,'' Mr Fowler said . ''We are benefiting from the thrust away from European imports and seeing a substantial volume and profit swing .'' Labatt's has an estimated 8 percent of the American market and expects to send about 300 ,000 barrels of beer into the United States by the end of its current fiscal year . Charles Roura x manager of Houston Street Beer Distributors Inc . in lower Manhattan x agreed that consumers have been expressing an increasing preference for Canadian beers . ''Last year x for example x we didn't bother to sell Moosehead x but we do now ,'' Mr Roura said x referring to a Canadian brand whose visibility on the American market is small but growing . The Mexican brands have also increased their market xshare . According to Mr Fernandez of Moctezuma Imports x Dos Equis x which sells in 48 states x is running 20 percent ahead of last year in retail sales . As he sees it x his brand's success mainly reflects consumer willingness to try different beers x as xwell as aggressive promotion x rather than a cheaper price .

Joblessness among the 10 members of the European Economic Community has mounted relentlessly from 3 percent in 1973 to 8dot8 percent x 9dot7 million people x and is continuing to rise . Worsening economic conditions and the unencouraging outlook have made leaders fearful of the possible political and social consequences . ''The way in which unemployment has risen in the past three years is appalling ,'' said Ivor Richard x a commissioner of the European Economic Community and Britain's former chief delegate to the United Nations . ''Governments are beginning to run scared .'' The repercussions of the European difficulties have also reached the United States x where worry over trans Atlantic trade disputes is growing .

"18",48902,"President Reagan is being told that he must accept either higher budget deficits over the next three years or ask Congress to adopt tax increases that would raise billions of dollars in that period x White House spokesmen said today . But they said that Mr Reagan was clinging to his hope of making further spending cuts to xbalance budget by 1984 . Mr Reagan was presented with the new fiscal dilemma at a review process that started yesterday and continued today at a luncheon meeting of the President and his main political and economic advisers . Congress and Recession Factors The review was made necessary by two factors . One is stiffening Congressional resistance x even among Republicans x to further deep cuts in Government spending that Mr Reagan still favors as the main tool for achieving his goal of a xbalance budget by 1984 . The other factor is the economy's slide into what the Administration officials call ''a mild recession'' despite assurances given Mr Reagan by White House economists that 1981 would be a year of economic growth . The review raised x for the first time in Mr Reagan's term x the possibility of a retreat on key elements of his plan to xbalance budget through spending cuts and reduce taxes at the same time . A White House aide said today that Mr Reagan himself was in a quandary about which way to turn to combat an economic squeeze that (none) not his advisers foresaw . A number of White House aides insisted today there was (no) not anger at the forecasters for fail to xpredict the economic slump that appears to be driving the budget deficit beyond the $43 billion level sought by Mr Reagan for the 1982 fiscal year . But the aides acknowledged that the Reagan Administration was at an economic crossroads . ''The first thing you do is try to get the President to make some decisions about what he wants to do ,'' an adviser said . ''Right now he wants to try to live up to what he said on Sept 24 .'' On that date x Mr Reagan told a national television audience that he wanted $13 billion in supplementary spending cuts in 1982 x in addition to the $37 billion spending reduction approved earlier in the year . To help hold the deficit down x Mr Reagan said he would also support a modest $3 billion increase in taxes . But now Mr Reagan's situation is complicated by what one fiscal policy official described as an intense dispute over the size of that tax increase between the Administration's main economic thinkers x Treasury Secretary Donald T . Regan and David A . Stockman x the director of the Office of Management and Budget . $60 Billion Over Three Years Mr Stockman is said to want to shrink the deficit by imposing a much larger tax increase that would produce $60 billion in new revenues in the next three years . But x White House and budget officials said x Mr Regan believes this would be a betrayal of the President's supply side economic theory that holds that deep tax cuts will stimulate business growth sufficiently to produce an overall increase in tax revenues . David R . Gergen x the senior White House spokesman x said today that the President was leaning toward Mr Regan's view . It is in keeping with the President's Sept 24 policy statement that spending reductions have to be the main tool in bringing about a xbalance budget . But that is where Mr Reagan's economic theory runs into Congressional opposition . Senator Howard H . Baker Jr . of Tennessee x the majority leader x has already informed the White House that Senate Republicans will support only about half the $13 billion in supplementary budget cuts requested on Sept 24 . Also x Senate Republicans are talking of $60 billion in tax increases over three years x an amount close to the Stockman figure x rather than the $22 billion tax increase that the White House is willing to support over the same period if it is called ''revenue enhancement'' rather than a tax rise . At today's White House luncheon x a participant reported x Mr Reagan received more bad news from Capitol Hill . Of the 13 appropriations bills now before Congress x Mr Reagan was told x the eight largest are running above his original March budget figures and do note into account the additional trims he asked for on Sept 24 . Prelude to Baker Meeting Today's meeting included the President's first string economic advisers x Mr Regan x Mr Stockman and Murray L . Weidenbaum x chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers . But it was a prelude x aides acknowledged x to the week's most crucial session . That will probably come on Thursday x when Senator Baker and other Republican Congressional leaders come to the White House to hear what adjustments Mr Reagan is willing to make in his Sept 24 proposal . Before that time x a White House aide said x Mr Reagan must decide ''whether we push for the budget cuts or buy into the various tax proposals that are floating around .'' Mr Gergen said today that it was possible Mr Reagan might choose to fight for his Sept 24 plan x even though White House advisers privately acknowledged this would mean an open break with vital Congressional allies in the President's own party . Senator Baker x seeking to find a compromise that would satisfy Congress and save face for the White House x today proposed creation of a xtrust fund to finance military spending . It would x like the highway xtrust fund used to construct the interstate system x earmark certain tax revenues for defense . This would ease the competition between military and social programs for a shrinking pool of tax dollars . ''We are searching for a way to get them out of competition with each other ,'' Senator Baker said x adding that he did not know how such a trust would be supplied with money . But x he added x he had abandoned his earlier proposal for a national sales tax to finance a defense xtrust fund . 'Take It Away With the Other' Mr Gergen said today that Mr Reagan was reluctant to approve any tax increase after having won Congressional approval to reduce income taxes by 25 percent over three years . The President's view is ''that he does@ not want to give money back with one hand and take it away with the other ,'' Mr Gergen added . Some Administration officials x speaking with the guarantee of anonymity x acknowledge that Mr Reagan now appears to be a victim of the success he had in ramming that tax cut through Congress . He acted then on the basis of what one official called ''totally unrealistic'' economic forecasts . They indicated that economic growth would be such that x even with tax cuts x there would still be enough Government revenue to fund essential social and defense spending . Now x with revenues diminished by both the Reagan tax cut and the recession x the official concluded x Mr Reagan must choose between spending reductions that could touch off Congressional rebellion or tax increases that violated his own philosophy .

"20",48946,"The 22 country North South meeting in Cancun x Mexico x affords an opportunity for Washington to make a strong commitment to global economic recovery . Instead x the Administration views the meeting x which begins Thursday x as a pulpit from which it can preach platitudes about self reliance . This view ignores the significance of Cancun x history's first North South summit conference x and imperils United States trade x jobs x and corporate profits . The Administration and its equally myopic predecessors have not perceived the indissoluble link between economic recovery in the industrial North and promotion of growth in the developing South . At the Ottawa economic summit meeting in July x our industrial allies tried to get this point across to President Reagan along with the message that the world economic crisis is the North's No . 1 foreign policy problem . The Administration's responded by reciting its set piece on Soviet danger and the need to spend huge sums on armaments . Our allies understand the arithmetic of collaborative North South development programs . For every dollar of foreign aid that the United States has ''bestowed ,'' it has earned a cumulative return of $2 .50 from resulting exports . Nearly one out of seven jobs and $1 out of every $3 of corporate profits in the United States come from our international commerce . For the United States x as for Japan and Europe x the third world has become the largest and fastest growing export market . Even when he was Secretary of Defense x in the 1960's x Robert S . McNamara began to insist that our national security was threatened by third world poverty and the opportunities it provided for Soviet expansionism . Today x we have another persistent blind spot . We refuse to xsee that our economy and those of our industrial allies can not recover unless we all effectively eliminate North South obstacles to trade and investment . Without such measures x global stagflation will continue x and we shall (neither) not restore the economic health of the North (nor) not reduce world poverty . Our allies have become sensitive to another basic fact: The global economic crisis x caused by the alarming decline to xthird world clients since these sales aid the sellers' balance of payments . However x these arms directly reduce developing countries' spending for economic growth . (without) not growth x our most rapidly expanding markets will atrophy . Economic benefits from defense outlays are needlessly expensive and dangerous on other counts . Numerous studies show that defense spending x when compared to nondefense investment x leads to fewer additional jobs x adds (little) not industrial capacity x and has a greater inflationary impact . Further x according to documentation by the International Institute of Strategic Studies x in London x current arms exports are weakening American and allied military production capabilities and making it harder for all to meet their own more important ''hardware'' objectives . As long as defense preparedness is evoked as the categorical imperative of national security x questions of world economic health will not addressed . In a globally interdependent United States economy x international economic stability is as much a part of our national security as is our military preparedness . What we need is a national security policy to balance equally important needs: development of a stronger defense capability x and revival in the South of capital formation x which is the basis of our export business and the means for attacking third world poverty . Since Ottawa x foreign ministers' preparations for Cancun and reactions from the International Monetary Fund World Bank meeting indicate an emerging conflict between the United States and its industrial allies and the United States and its friends in the South . In contrast to us x they are forging a new global policy view . Their common economic interests point them to a dual approach for restoring global stability . One is the need to renew strategic arms limitations negotiations and to complement them with superpower negotiations to limit their arms shipments to the third world . The second is adoption of one of a score of proposals for a comprehensive North South attack on the world economic crisis . Cancun will test whether Mr Reagan understands why his address at the IMF . World Bank meeting the other day received faint applause .

"21",49112,"The Government's Producer Price Index for finished goods x a rough measure of the level of inflation consumers will face in the future x edged up by only four tenths of 1 percent in July x despite a large increase in the price of food x the Labor Department reported today . This was a slightly better outcome than many economists had expected x and appeared to extend the gains that the United States has made against inflation during the last year . In another report x the Federal Reserve Board said that the nation's factories and mines increased their production by threetenths of 1 percent last month . The rise x much of which was attributed to a rebound in coal output after the miners' strike x came despite forecasts that the American economy was entering a recession . (Page 29 .) More Consumer Buying Power The small rise in the Producer Price Index ''is a good indication that inflation is going to remain in single digits in the foreseeable future ,'' commented David Ernst x of Evans Economics x a Washington consultant . In addition x he said x subdued inflation meant that consumers had more real buying power x and this would help keep the economy x which now may not growing at all x from sliding into a full fledged recession . Other economists x however x warned that President Reagan x who this week signed into law his budget and tax cuts x now faces a period in which it will be increasingly difficult to curb inflation further . Oil prices x they said x may have stopped decline to xbe working to his advantage .'' Now x Mr Woodworth added x ''what we are going to see is the unwinding of the really good price news .'' Such concerns may be a major reason x in the view of some economists x that interest rates have reached record levels this month x despite a pace of inflation much lower than all but the most optimistic forecasters had predicted last winter and spring . The Consumer Price Index x for example x which rose 12 .4 percent in 1980 x is now expected to average only 8 percent to 9 percent this year . The Reagan Administration x which in February estimated that the consumer index would rise 11 .1 percent in 1981 x last month revised this down to 8dot6 percent . It was at 7dot4 percent through June . No flare up of inflation is in prospect over the next month or two x according to Jack W . Lavery x chief economist at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc . x but there is ''a fear of reacceleration'' that could come later this year . ''The progress we have achieved to date was far easier than the incremental progress likely from here on ,'' Mr Lavery said . Food Rise Was Expected Analysts x however x found relatively (little) not today's report to worry about . The 1dot5 percent advance in the consumer food component of the finished goods index was largely expected since the food component at the crude stage of production jumped in June by 2dot8 percent x the biggest rise since last August . Crude foods rose only three tenths of 1 percent in July . But the makeup of and the revisions in the Producer Price Index x which is relied on as both a base for escalator clauses in business contracts and as a harbinger of consumer prices x have drawn fire from critics on various counts x including the fact that it does not include the prices of services purchased by corporations . Mr Woodworth of Bankers Trust said he was concerned about the frequency and magnitude of index revisions . In spite of the fact that the Labor Department seeks to (avoid) not revisions because of the problems this poses for users x he added x he was ''amazed'' in researching the subject to find that the last time an originally reported monthly total was not subsequently altered was in December 1979 . Finished Goods Data Changed His complaint seemed to be borne out again today . The finished goods index for March x originally reported to have climbed 1dot3 percent x was later revised down to nine tenths of 1 percent and today was revised again x to 1dot2 percent . Similarly x the original climb of eight tenths of 1 percent in the index for pril has now been reduced to five tenths of 1 percent . The problem x he suggested x seemed to reflect ''haphazard or late reporting from substantial numbers of corporate and trade association respondents .'' Crude goods x raw materials ,rose by five tenths of 1 percent last month x while intermediate goods x such as steel or textiles x rose by just four tenths of 1 percent x the same as finished goods . Finished goods are commodities x such as a shirt x that will not undergo further processing and are ready for sale to the ultimate user . The fabric from which the shirt is woven is the intermediate product and raw cotton the crude product . The finished goods index x the one that is most widely followed x now stands at 271 .3 percent of its 1967 base of 100 . If food is disregarded x this index rose last month by just one tenth of 1 percent x the smallest monthly advance since May 1976 . The finished consumer goods component x which is regarded as the best predictor of the Consumer Price Index x rose by three tenths of 1 percent x down from five tenths of 1 percent in June . Energy Prices Show Drops Finished energy prices fell 1 percent and intermediate energy goods fell five tenths of 1 percent last month x but economists noted that retail gasoline prices x compiled by another source x rose during the first week of August for the first time since midwinter . Pork products x rising 10 .1 percent x and citrus fruit led the price increases among finished foods x while there were also substantial increases for beef and veal . Moreover x prices rose faster than in June for soft drinks and the end products of vegetable oil . One of the biggest surprises in the report x according to Mr Lavery of Merrill Lynch x was the durable goods element of finished consumer goods x which declined two tenths of 1 percent . This occurred despite higher automobile prices that have not reflected the latest round of rebates . Copyright 1981 The New York Times Company ","Positive",6052

Either bill would be an unprecedented restriction on the management of monetary policy .

It would institutionalize blatant political intrusion in a process that is already delicate . Officially x our central banking system is ''independent'' of White House influence .

Within this framework x however x the Fed has been free to design and redesign its methods x as it did three years ago in shifting its focus from interest rates to broad aggregates of the money supply . This monetarist approach may not the best answer to current problems x but it is certainly preferable to political dictation from Capitol Hill . The itch to curb the Fed at a time like this is understandable . The tightness of monetary policy has riled conservative Republicans as xwell as liberal Democrats . But why were these radical bills introduced just before the summer recess of a Congressional election year . Are they anything more than campaign fodder . Present law does not presume to tell the Fed what measures or targets it should use x or how high or low to set its objectives . The two Democratic proposals would demand a single rigid approach .

The Wright bill would force the Fed to aim instead at long term rates x an even more difficult technical assignment . Both bills commit the same basic error: they would restrict the Fed's flexibility to adjust to circumstances and give all its work an inflationary bias . The bill's critics may find it perversely comforting that the House Banking Committee plans only a single day of hearings on the Wright bill .

''If a banker resists interstate banking x thinking he can (avoid) not taken over or overrun by a bank in the adjoining state x he is just fooling himself . He will be overrun .

''A debt ridden world fraught with financial fragility requires not only lenders of last resort'' but also ''buyers of last resort ,'' the bank concludes x arguing that the four countries have a ''duty'' to increase domestic consumption . With faster growth rates x the bank notes x the four big countries would purchase more imports x thus aiding the economies of weaker nations and enabling them to repay debts . The bank x which is owned by the major Western central banks x is itself now a key player in efforts to bail out some third world and East European countries . Its annual report x which this year dwells heavily on the dangers this debt burden poses for the international economy x reflects the private thinking of the central banking community and is widely regarded as one of the most authoritative and lively commentaries on international economics . Steady Nerves Said to Be Needed But while economic revival in these four major countries is essential for world recovery x the bank warns x additional steps are also necessary to resolve the worldwide debt problem and insure that it does not cut short the emerging recovery . In particular x it urges private bankers to ''keep steady nerves'' and maintain lending to countries that are having trouble with debt payments so that they can keep the world economy expanding by continuing to import from the West . But it also wants them to cooperate more closely with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to (avoid) not overlending to particular countries and creating a new crisis . Between 1974 and 1982 x the bank says x private banks financed 45 percent of the developing world's aggregate external deficit . Although much of the international banking system's lending to developing countries is xshort term x last June x about 44 percent of the external debt of the 24 biggest debtors worth $171 billion matured in the following 12 months x the bank says the international financial system will remain vulnerable to shocks . It appears sympathetic toward plans for consolidating this debt x provided they do not reduce the flow of new finance to countries needing to borrow . The bank also calls for ''sharply increased resources'' to be put at the disposal of the IMF . and the World Bank so that these institutions can help finance the deficits third world countries will continue to run for many years as they import goods needed for their development . In the bank's view x the United States x Britain x West Germany and Japan now have a duty to the international community to insure the current economic recovery is sustained by strengthening domestic demand in their own economies because they have made the best progress in overcoming inflation . Interest Rates Must Come Down In the United States x the overwhelming need is for action to reduce interest rates by closing the yawning budget deficit x the report says . ''From every conceivable angle the most important and urgent task for policy is to exert downward pressure on United States interest rates ,'' it adds . But the other three countries x which have much smaller deficits x could safely apply ''modest doses of selective fiscal stimuli to private capital spending x provided great care is taken that such stimuli do not a permanent feature of the public finances ,'' the bank says . It also wants to see ''an acceleration of public sector investment outlays'' provided these are offset by cuts in social payments . All could also adopt more ''flexible'' monetary policies . By encouraging low inflation countries to reflate after years of warning about the dangers of inflation x the bank has now joined ranks with the Organization for Economic Coorperation and Development in arguing that the greatest danger facing the world economy is slow growth and the possibility that the current slender recovery under way in the United States and Europe could abort if not recovery . Although noting that the root causes of low growth in the West do not lie in a shortage of demand for its goods in the rest of the world x the bank argues that ''decline to xenvisage a broadly based and lasting recovery in the Western world as long as the fear of the potentially damaging financial consequences of a world debt crisis is not fundamentally allayed .''

But opposition by the relatively healthy states of the Sun Belt has blocked a third effort to rescue some of the hard pressed states of the Frost Belt by reversing some of the budget cutting measures adopted by Congress two years ago . Extended unemployment benefits are critical for many workers x because they enable families to maintain a reasonable standard of living and (avoid) not go back by their industries ,'' said Peggy Taylor x legislative representative for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations . Basic Coverage 26 Weeks Because Congress has been slow to enact other aid programs for the jobless x Miss Taylor added x the extended unemployment benefits become ''all that more important .'' The basic unemployment program covers workers for 26 weeks and is financed by employer contributions . Extra benefits x financed by state and Federal contributions x have been gradually added in recent years . Today x workers in states with the highest unemployment rates can qualify for a total of 55 weeks of benefits . But an important part of that extended benefits program is scheduled to expire at the end of March . The White House suggested continuing current coverage through the end of the year at a cost of $2dot9 billion . But Democrats on the Subcommittee on Public Assistance and Unemployment Compensation of the House Ways and Means Committee rejected the Administration's plan and recommended that top priority be placed on the 1dot3 million jobless workers who have already exhausted the 55 weeks of benefits . Under a bill adopted by the subcommittee on Thursday x those who use up benefits by April 1 would be eligible for an extra 10 weeks of help x for a total of 65 weeks . A 6 Month Extension But the Democrats also used some sleight of hand . They extended the extra benefits program for only six months x instead of nine months x and so the total cost of their package was (no) not greater than the White House proposal . Representative Henson Moore x Republican of Louisiana x accused the Democrats of duplicity and said that the extra months would have to be added eventually . ''We all know the recession will not over in six months ,'' he said . The subcommittee also dismissed a White House suggestion that some benefits be paid in vouchers x rather than cash . The vouchers could then be given by the workers to employers that agree to hire them x and the employers x in turn x would receive a tax xcredit for the vouchers . Expresses Fear of Plan The Administration maintained that the system would encourage companies to hire displaced workers x but according to Representative Robert T . Matsui x Democrat of California x Democrats feared that the companies would dismiss entrenched workers to hire newcomers and get the tax breaks . He called the plan ''dead on arrival'' at the subcommittee . The extended benefits package could come before the full Ways and Means Committee next week and might be added to legislation that revises the financing of the Social Security system . Representative Moore warned that the jobless bill was ''too xrich'' and might help sink the Social Security bill x but Representative Dan Rostenkowski x the Illinois Democrat who heads the panel x scoffed at the idea . With unemployment at 10 .4 percent x Mr Rostenkowski argued x it is ''hard to believe'' that supporting jobless aid would be a political liability for most lawmakers . The second Congressional effort came Friday x when the House Appropriations Committee approved a supplemental appropriations bill containing $5 billion to shore up the unemployment system . The money would be lent by the Federal Government to states that are having trouble financing their own xshare for the fiscal year 1983 . now the estimate is 10 .7 percent x and the total cost of the program is expected to balloon from $20 billion to $33 billion . The emergency bill x which also contains a $4dot6 billion jobs package x is scheduled for House action on Wednesday . The third problem facing the unemployment system stems from the rules under which states borrow money from Washington to meet their payments . The Reagan budget plan in 1981 forced the states to pay interest on the loans . For Michigan x for example x the interest bill comes to more than $200 ,000 a day . Gov . James J .

"71",52213," During the 1970's x Western Europe made a promising start toward clearing up the environmental mess left by 20 years of unfettered economic growth . New laws forced industry to adopt cleaner working habits x while the recession and rising energy prices curbed the burning of polluting fuels and the production of hazardous wastes . European economies cut sulfur emissions 15 percent in the last decade (about 10 percent (less) not in the United States) x and sharply reduced smoke and dust pollution . For the first time in a century x salmon are being caught in the Thames off London Bridge .  Even so x the roll call of ecological disasters continues x reminders like Seveso and the Amoco Cadiz of the fragility of past environmental gains . While economic growth means fewer unemployed x it also means more factories befouling the air and water x more cars and trucks jamming the roads x even more litter to be scattered around the countryside . One of the more interesting political lessons of the recession x however x was that rising unemployment did not blunt popular pressure for a cleaner world . Polls made in 1982 x when economic prospects seemed bleak x show that 49 percent of Americans and 59 percent of Europeans were ready to accept slower growth to protect the environment . The evidence seems to indicate that environmental pressure is mounting as economies recover . Last week x West German parliamentarians were forced to interrupt summer vacations and hurry back to Bonn after a political storm over a smoky power station briefly threatened Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition Governmment . In the end x the Government defeated a censure motion over its plans to bring the coal burning plant into service (without) not filters to reduce sulfur emissions blamed for acid rain x but only because it promised to have the filters in place six months earlier than previously planned x and agreed to cut emissions from two other power stations in the meantime . It was the second indication in recent weeks that Europeans were heeding the threat of acid rain . In June x the Soviet Union and its East European satellites joined the so called ''30 percent club'' of nations committed to cutting sulfur emissions a third below 1980 levels by 1993 . For the first time x these countries acknowledged that their forests are also suffering x although the Czechoslovakian delegate blamed capitalist industry in Western Europe . Earlier that month x environmental authorities from the Western countries met in Paris to look at the ecological consequences of renewed economic expansion . The conclusion: While Governments everywhere face increased pressure to improve environmental standards x faster growth makes cleanups more affordable .  The Price of Growth Indeed x many now see environmental controls as helping recovery x not obstructing it . ''The fear environmental action would hinder our economies appears misplaced ,'' said the Dutch environmental minister x Pieter Winsemius . According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development x if Western economies keep growing at an average rate of 3 percent a year x they will need to greatly increase spending on pollution controls to maintain present environmental standards . Britain x Germany x Norway and Sweden x for example x would face an increase of between 10 percent and 30 percent . Austria x Belgium x Italy and Denmark would have to more than double their investment x while in Spain x Portugal and Greece x which have been lax about the environment x environmental spending would have to multiply between four and 10 times just to keep pollution levels constant . Western Europe now spends $1dot5 billion a year cleaning up toxic wastes x while cutting sulfur emissions 50 percent would cost between $8 billion and $13 billion x according to one new study . Industrialists complain that such burdens raise production costs x reduce research spending x make their companies (less) not efficent and eventually lower employment . Yet many economists now believe that investment in environmental controls may assist economic growth by reducing waste x stimulating invention and creating a whole new industry . Damage to buildings in Europe from sulfur emissions alone is estimated at between $500 million and $2dot7 billion annually x while Germany reckons it has lose the xsound management of natural resouces have now become essential to sustainable economic growth .''

"73",52289,"The nation's major banks increased their prime lending rate to 13 percent yesterday x from 12 1/2 percent . The action x which was led by the First National Bank of Chicago and xquick look for several more increases in early 1985 x with the peak to be hit at 16 1/2 percent in next year's second quarter .'' Some bankers attributed the rise in the prime to the Federal Reserve System x saying that the central bank was not creating enough money to finance the economic expansion . Usually such reluctance is because the Federal Reserve fears that creating excessive money will lead to inflation . But inflation has been quite low compared with recent years . Many of those economists who attribute the unusually high interest rates to the large Federal budget deficit said upward pressure on the rates may be reduced as a result of last week's agreement in Congress to reduce the deficit by $50 billion . Referring to that package x Senator Bob Dole x the Kansas Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee x said that ''I think this ought to be the right signal to keep'' interest rates ''from going up any more .'' The rate increase provoked fears about its impact on the heavily indebted countries of Latin America x Economists estimate x for example x that each percentage point increase in interest rates costs Brazil about $800 million a year . This quarter most of the major United States banks are likely to report significantly lower earnings because of the expected fail to xbring its interest payments up to date . To offset the effects of Argentina x the banks have to earn more elsewhere x and that means they must pass increases in their costs of funds along to their customers . But that makes it even more difficult for their problem clients to pay their debts . ''We are caught in a Catch 22 situation ,'' said Mr Donovan of Marine Midland . Political Consequences Cited Some analysts x however x such as William R . Cline of the Institute of International Economics in Washington x said that the political consequences of the increase will be more significant than its economic impact . Mr Cline said that the strength of the United States economy x which makes it easy for the debtor countries to sell their exports here x more than offsets the higher interest rates . In a telephone interview from Caracas x Venezuela x yesterday x Mr Cline said that Mexico and Brazil x the two biggest Latin American debtors x have been doing extremely xwell in straightening out their international financial problems . But x he added x for the leaders of many of the Latin American countries the rate increase will add to their ''political frustration x a xsense that the problem is not manageable . that's especially insidious at this time because the economic reality is that these countries are over achieving .'' Effect on Savings Institutions The other major concern is the effect on the nation's savings and loan associations and its savings banks x which are seriously hurt when interest rates rise because they must pay more to attract and keep deposits x while the interest they collect on their fixed rate x long term mortgages remains basically unchanged .

Now x the upturn in the United States economy is at last beginning to result in slight improvement . ''Is the mining industry a xlittle better off than a year ago .'' asked Robert ED Woolsey x professor of mineral economics at the Colorado School of Mines . ''It is . Coal is beginning to see some upturn in demand x particularly for coal companies that are now willing to go with long term contracts for a xlittle (less) not money than they would like . The reopening of the molybdenum mines is telling us that the demand for steel is coming up .'' Most experts agree that a full recovery is far down the road . Moreover x there is ample evidence that most states in the region are bouncing back from recession regardless of conditions in the mines x a sign of the extent to which the states have diversified their economies . The Western states' mines are at the end of an economic chain . Coal mines x for instance x are vulnerable to a shutdown at some factory or mill at the other end of a power line 1 ,000 miles away . Similarly x the price of Nevada's gold varies with events abroad . The need for Wyoming's soda ash rises and falls with the market for plate glass x Utah's uranium with the health of distant nuclear power plants .

Accordingly x because more and more blast furnaces elsewhere in the country are firing up x Amax Incorporated's Henderson molybdenum mine in Henderson x Colo . x called back 700 men to mine the mineral x which is used in hardening steel . This week x the company's Climax mine in Leadville x west of here x will put another 700 men to work producing the first ore from that mine since September 1982 . Terry Fitsimmons x a spokesman x expressed optimism that the demand would remain . ''We wouldn't plan on bringing them back on a temporary basis ,'' he said . ''As far as we are concerned x the mine is opened and will stay opened .'' Gold mining is showing renewed strength in Nevada and Idaho x in part because of improvements in techniques for separating the mineral from ore . Silver mining is being encouraged in the expectation that the growth in the production of computers x in whose circuits silver is used x will push up prices .  Copper: Still Awaiting RecoveryAmax's Powder River coal mines are anticipating a 3 to 5 percent production increase this year x according to Don Warfield x a spokesman . ''It will be (nothing) not like the 30 percent growth we were seeing in the past ,'' he said . ''Up until 1980 we were going like gangbusters .'' Not all coal fields are showing even the modest prospects of the Powder River Basin x however . As the low prices being offered for Federal coal leases last xfall indicated x demand is still far from what it was a decade ago . There remains an area of unrelieved gloom in western mining: Copper x a metal that has made more money and perhaps produced more drama in the region than gold and silver combined x remains at Depression levels . The open pit copper mines of Montana x Utah and Arizona (which used to style itself The Copper State) x are popularly believed to be the only man made things visible from the moon x but today (no) not telescope would reveal the bustle that once marked King Copper's strength in those states . Anaconda Minerals Company shut down its huge Butte x Mont . x pit last year .

Copper prices remain caught between 70 and 80 cents a pound x (less) not dollar a pound level the companies say they need to go back to work x and far below the $1 .25 level they hit in 1980 . ''It's hard for us to understand ,'' said Mr Hansen of the Arizona Mining Association . ''Usually when housing and automobiles pick up so do we .

George Deukmejian said today that government in California x which was on the brink of bankruptcy a year ago x will have enough money in its next fiscal year to set aside an emergency fund of almost $1 billion while sharply increasing spending for schools x universities x state employee salaries and a wide range of other needs .  ''Our common sense policies have restored confidence in California as a good place to do business and they have helped to spur an economic recovery that is the best we have seen in decades ,'' Mr Deukmejian said in his annual State of the State Message to a joint session of the Legislature . Mr Deukmejian x a Republican x submitted to the Democratic controlled Legislature a budget of $29 .9 billion for the fiscal year beginning July 1 . The budget is about $4 billion x or 13 percent x higher than a year ago . No tax increases were proposed . Big Increase for University Surprising some of his antagonists in the Legislature x with whom he has waged a battle over spending priorities since taking office a year ago x Mr Deukmejian gave high priority to improvements in the state's system of four year colleges and universities . The administrators of these institutions had complained in recent years that budget cutbacks threatened their long held reputation as among the nation's best . The budget proposes a 30 percent increase x to $1dot4 billion x for the general fund of the University of California x including a 16 percent increase in faculty salaries that Mr Deukmejian said would enable the university ''help attract and retain the very best professors x researchers and scientists in the nation .'' The Governor also proposes spending $900 million to continue and expand a statewide improvement program in the public schools that began last September x $3dot3 billion on capital improvements for roads x buildings and other public facilities x big increases in allotments for prisons x and a 10 percent salary increase for state employees . Mr Deukmejian x noting local governments in California had become overdependent on the state for their economic sustenance since voters took away much of their property taxing powers in 1978 x said he would seek legislative approval for what he called a ''new partnership'' with local governments . 'Unshackle Local Governments' He said this working accord would give cities and counties an independent source of revenue x using a combination of motor vehicle taxes and other sources . ''It's time to unshackle local governments and let them do their job ,'' he said . It was a day on which Mr Deukmejian could afford to boast . He was riding high in public opinion polls and in editorial support from most of the state's newspapers after governing during a period of a dramatic economic turnaround . A year ago x he noted x the state was close to insolvency . It faced a $1dot5 billion deficit and was nearly forced to issue i .o .u .'s to pay its bills . He resisted strong pressure from Democrats in the Legislature to enact a large across the board tax increase x saying the economy would rebound and increase the state's tax collections . His forecast turned out to be conservative . In addition to proposing the setting aside of a $950 million fund for potential emergencies x the Governor proposed a budget that offered something for just about everyone except junior college students . While being generous to the state's four year colleges x Mr Deukmejian said he would continue to insist x as he did last year x that students pay a $50 a semeseter fee at the state's 106 junior colleges x which are now tuition free . He Seeks 2percent Welfare Increase Observing that California x with 10 percent of the nation's population x was paying at least 19 percent of the total benefits paid in general welfare in the nation x he asked legislators to authorize a 2 percent increase in benefits for welfare recipients in the next fiscal year . He also said he would press for enactment of a law requiring physically able recipients to take jobs . The initial reaction to Mr Deukmejian's speech from Democrats was not strongly critical . David Roberti x the President pro tem of the Senate and one of the Governor's principal antagonists over the past year x deplored the small increases in welfare payments and the demand for junior college tuition . Mr Roberti said the budget mirrored the ''upper middle class'' outlook of Mr Deukmejian . He applauded the proposals for increased spending at the universities and certain environmental programs x but said the budget was x nevertheless x one in which poor people would suffer . Willie Brown Jr . x the Speaker of the State Assembly x was (less) not critical . ''I think it is basically a positive budget ,'' Mr Brown said .

"79",52639,"The United States economy seem xlike more of the same x with the economy growing but in a rather sluggish fashion .'' The Reagan Administration x for its part x is believed to have tentatively adopted a 4 percent growth forecast for next year x somewhat higher than that of most private analysts . To be sure x few economists or politicians are satisfied with the current rate of American growth x (less) not 2dot5 percent for 1985 after 6dot6 percent in 1984 . This year's rate has been barely xenough to keep unemployment from rising and it has left industry with large amounts of idle productive capacity . Moreover x agriculture and parts of the oil x real estate and banking industries are in disarray despite an expansion that this month reached its third anniversary . Weak farm and xcrude oil prices x as xwell as a glut of unrented office space in some cities x could cause more problems for banks in 1986 . Yet most economists predict solid growth for 1986 . They cite several factors for this tempered optimism . Both interest rates and the dollar's value are down x the Federal Reserve has already produced rapid expansion of the money supply and oil prices seem headed still lower x which is a boon to users . Corporate plans to raise capital spending by only a negligible amount are likely to be offset by a fresh impetus in consumer spending that until recently had seemed to be leveling off . ''Our members have pushed their 1986 growth forecasts successively higher over the past six months ,'' said Kathleen M . Cooper x president of the National Association of Business Economists . A 300 member sample of this group expects the gross national product x the nation's total output of goods and services x to rise next year by 2dot9 percent after allowing for inflation . This compares with the 3dot1 percent advance projected by the 50 economists regularly surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators x an Arizona based forecasting xorganized by 3dot7 percent x barely xhigher than the 3dot6 percent increase that has prevailed for the last 12 months . Last year's prediction for 1985 was for inflation of 4dot5 percent . A perhaps under appreciated factor in the outlook x but one attracting increased attention x is the momentum imparted by the soaring securities markets . Although stock and bond prices generally tend to reflect expectations of business conditions x major swings in prices can also become an active force for expansion or contraction of the economy . ''Gains in securities prices ,'' said the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company's latest economic survey x ''have boosted the wealth of households x a plus for consumer spending x as xwell as lowered the cost of financial capital x a plus for investment .'' According to Lawrence A . Kudlow x president of Rodman and Renshaw Economics Inc . and a former Reagan Administration economist x the markets have added as much as $1 trillion to the nation's wealth during the last 18 months x an amount equal to three months of the GNP . ''To be sure x not everyone in the economy owns stocks and bonds ,'' he said . ''But the central point is that the economic activists x the entrepreneurs and risk takers x drive the economy through investment and employment actions . These decisions to spend on new equipment x new structures x new technologies x as xwell as new employment x are the crucial steps necessary to reinvigorate or revitalize an economy .'' Statistics showing high consumer debt and low savings x many analysts say x should therefore be seen as an overly gloomy assessment of the likely inclination and ability of consumers to spend next year . Most economists x moreover x think the economy will become progressively better xbalance budget deficits under the new deficit reduction act could be a force for economic contraction for 1986 and the next several years .

"82",52746,"An auto buying spree pushed consumer spending up a giant 1dot2 percent in September x the Commerce Department reported today x but the growth of incomes of Americans remained sluggish . Personal consumption spending rose four times as fast as the gain of three tenths of 1 percent in personal income . Buyers made up the difference by dipping into savings x putting their xsavings rate at 1dot9 percent of disposable income x the lowest figure since the Government began keeping data in 1959 . The combination of weak income growth and low savings could spell trouble for the economy x analysts said x if consumers cut back sharply on purchases in coming months . Driving Force of Recovery While consumer spending has been the driving force in the current recovery x economists said those gains must be supported by similar increases in incomes to be sustained . This year x personal incomes have grown at a moderate 4dot2 percent annual rate x far below last year's 9dot8 percent increase . While consumers have not pulled back on spending yet x economists say cuts are overdue . ''The consumer x like everybody else in this economy x is living beyond his means ,'' said David Wyss x economist at Data Resources Inc . ''He is going to have to pull back and get the xsavings rate up to a more reasonable level .'' Data Resources is predicting that the overall economy will slip to growth of 2dot5 percent in the final three months this year and fall to a 1dot5 percent rate in the first half of 1986 . The Government reported Thursday that the economy rebounded to a 3dot3 percent growth rate in the July September quarter x three times the pace of the first six months of the year . Two Thirds of the GNP . Mr Wyss said a slowdown would be caused in large part by lower consumer spending . ''Since consumer spending is two thirds of the gross national product x when consumers slow down x the GNP . slows down ,'' he added . The big increase in spending in September matched August's 1dot2 percent increase . Both were attributed to heavy sales of autos as buyers responded to attractive cut rate financing packages being offered at the end of the model year . However x analysts noted that x for the latest selling period x the first 10 days of October x car sales decline to xa low xsavings rate x other statistics show that consumer debt has hit an all time high of 19 percent of disposable income x topping the old mark of 17 .8 percent in 1978 .

The civilian unemployment rate x which excludes the military people covered by the overall rate x was 7dot3 percent x also unchanged since January . The report x the first broad indication of economic activity last month x was viewed as an indication that the economy might not grow at the vigorous 5 percent rate forecast by the White House .

"88",52984,"Following is a transcript of President Reagan's address to the nation last night on taxes x as recorded by The New York Times: My fellow citizens x I would like to speak to you tonight about our future x about a great historic effort to give the words freedom x fairness and hope new meaning and power for every man and woman in America . Specifically x I want to talk about taxes . about what we must do as a nation this year to transform a system that's become an endless source of confusion and resentment into one that is clear x simple and fair for all . a tax code that (no) (no longer) not run xagainst a tax system that is unwise x unwanted and unfair . I have spoken with and received letters from thousands of you x Republicans x Democrats and Independents . I know how hungry you are for change . Make (no) not mistake x we x the sons and daughters of those first brave souls who came to this land to give birth to a new life in liberty x we can change America . we can change America forever . So let us get started x let us change the tax code to make it fairer x and change tax rates so they are lower . The proposal I am putting forth tonight for America's future will free us from the grip of special interests and create a binding commitment to the only xspecial interest that counts x you x the people who pay America's bills . It will create million xworth of any economic policy must be measured by the strength of its commitment to American families x the bedrock of our society . There is (no) not instrument of hard work x savings and job creation as effective as the family . There is (no) not cultural institution as ennobling as family life . And there is (no) not superior x indeed x (no) not equal means to rear the young x protect xagainst inflation . New Incentives For Savings Further x we will increase the standard deduction x raising it to $4 ,000 for joint returns . Beyond this we intend to strengthen families' incentives to save through individual retirement accounts x IRA .'s x by nearly doubling x to $4 ,000 x the amount all couples can deduct from their taxable income . From now on each spouse could put up to $2 ,000 a year into his or her IRA . and invest the money however they want . And the value of the IRA . would not taxable until they approach retirement . Some families could save more x others (less) not x but whether it's $400 or $4 ,000 x every dollar saved up to $4 ,000 each year would be fully deductible from taxable earnings . Let me add that we would also raise x by nearly a full third x the special tax xcredit for low income working Americans . That special incentive x a credit to reduce the tax they owe x would be raised from the present $550 to a maximum level of over $700 . Now let us look at some examples of families in different income groups to illustrate how dramatically these incentives could help you to better your lives . Take a family of four struggling at a poverty level existence with an annual income of $12 ,000 . By nearly doubling the personal exemption and raising the standard deduction we will x as I said before x guarantee that that family pays (no) not income tax at all . Lighter Tax On Extra Earnings But what if x being industrious x they go out and earn more x say $5 ,000 more x how much tax would they pay . Only 15 cents on each dollar of the additional $5 ,000 . They would thus pay a total tax of only $750 on $17 ,000 of earnings . That's (less) not 5 percent on their total income . We are offering a ladder of opportunity for every family that feel xlike comparing the distance between a Model T and the space shuttle . And I should know . I have seen both . I have spoken of our proposed changes to help individuals and families . Let me explain how we would complement them with proposals for business x proposals to ensure fairness by elminating or modifying special privileges that are economically unjustifiable x and to strengthen growth by preserving incentives for investment x research and development . We begin with a basic recognition: The greatest innovations for new jobs x technologies x and economic vigor today come from a small but growing circle of heroes x the small business people x American entrepreneurs x the men and women of faith x intellect and daring who take great risks to invest in and invent our future . The majority of the 8 million new jobs created over the last two and a half years were created by small enterprises x enterprises often born in the dream of one human heart . Suggestion Offered For Young Americans To young Americans wondering tonight x where will I go x what will I do with my future x I have a suggestion: Why not set out with your friends on the path of adventure and try to start up your own business . Follow in the footsteps of those two college students who launched one of America's great computer firms from the garage behind their house . Youxtoo x can help us unlock the doors to a golden future . Youxtoo x can become leaders in this great new era of progress x the age of the entrepreneur . My goal is an America bursting with opportunity x an America that celebrates freedom every day by giving every citizen an equal chance x an America that is once again the youngest nation on earth x her spirit unleashed and breaking free . For starters x lowering personal tax rates will give a hefty boost to the nearly 15 million small businesses which are individual proprietorships or partnerships . To further promote business formation we propose to reduce the maximum corporate tax rate x now 46 percent x to 33 percent . And most small corporations would pay even lower rates . So with lower rates small business can lead the way in creating jobs for all who want to work . To these incentives we would add another x a reduction in the tax on capital xgains . Since the capital xgains tax rates were cut in 1978 and 1981 x capital raised for new ventures has increased by over a hundredfold . That old x tired economy wheezing from neglect in the 1970's has been swept aside by a young x powerful locomotive of progress carrying a trainload of new jobs x higher incomes and opportunities for more and more Americans of average means . So to marshal more venture capital for more new industries x the kind of efforts that begin with a couple of partners setting out to create and develop a new product x we intend to lower the maximum capital xgains tax rate to 17 1/2 percent . Under our new tax proposal x the oil and gas industry will be asked to pick up a larger xshare for wells producing (less) not 10 barrels a day . By eliminating this special preference we will go a long way toward insuring that those who earn their wealth in the oil industry will be subject to the same taxes as the rest of us . This is only fair . To continue our drive for energy independence x the current treatment of the costs of exploring and drilling for new oil will be maintained . We are determined to cut back on special preferences that have too xlong favored some industries at the expense of others . We would repeal the investment tax xcredit and reform the depreciation system . Incentives for research and experimentation x however x would be preserved . There is one group of lose their xxdreams . The American dream belongs to you . it lives in millions of different hearts . it can be fulfilled in millions of different ways . And with you by our side we are not adjusted to account for inflation (beginning in 1985) enacted . Tames) TYPE: text Copyright 1985 The New York Times Company ","Positive",7559

"90",53052,"After three months of vacillation over the next move in monetary policy and interest rates x an increasing number of market participants decided last week that rates are headed lower and that the Federal Reserve will signal its intentions by reducing the discount rate it charges on loans to financial institutions .  Of course x there are many analysts who doubt that the Fed will make a xsignificant move to lower rates x and others who say that a drop in rates will be short lived x whether or not discount rate is cut from the 8 percent level that has prevailed since Dec 24 . But many others say a more generous monetary policy can be justified by economic and political developments . Economic activity was weaker than expected in the first quarter x and forecasts of a rebound in the second quarter may not enough to satisfy central bankers who see grave consequences for the world economy if the 2 1/2 year old American expansion should falter . Politically x lower interest rates could make legislators more willing to cut spending and the Federal budget deficit x and would also be welcomed by foreign leaders scheduled to meet in Bonn on May 3 for their annual economic summit conference . 'Definitive Move' Seen ''For weeks the market has been hearing from one Fed governor after another expressions of concern about the weak sectors of the economy that are not participating in the recovery ,'' said Victor Chang x managing director at Ehrlich Bober Government Securities . ''Now that the GNP . data confirm a general slowdown in the economy x the Fed is prepared to make a definitive move to an easier monetary policy x and will probably cut the discount rate this week or next .'' ''A cut in American interest rates would also be seen as a goodxfaith gesture in xadvance of the Bonn meeting ,'' Mr Chang said .

Others say rapid growth will continue and the 5dot5 percent growth rate in March was an aberration x not start of a trend . Concern About Inflation Albert M . Wojnilower x chief economist at the First Boston Corporation x said that the Fed will overlook rapid money supply growth and continue to focus on maintaining economic growth of 3 percent to 4 percent . The Fed's continued stimulative monetary policy will avert a recession x he said x though ''inflation is bound to accelerate .'' Any danger from an overheated economy is at least a year away x he added . In a speech at the annual meeting of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York x Mr Wojnilower noted that Fed policy can be criticized (no) not matter what course is taken .

"91",53121,"Strong consumer spending is propelling the economy to a robust 4 percent growth rate this quarter x just what the Reagan Administration ordered x according to many economists . The first quarter's growth rate x which is scheduled to be the subject of a ''flash'' estimate by the Commerce Department on Wednesday x will be a key indication of whether the economy is maintaining its momentum after recovering from a slowdown in the xfall . The economy x as measured by the gross national product x grew at a lethargic 1dot6 percent annual rate in the third quarter x but rebounded in October through December at a 4dot9 percent rate . If a 4 percent growth rate is indeed achieved x the most common prognosis is for a fairly good performance for the rest of the year . That optimism contrasts with some fears last xfall that the then dawdling economy would collapse into recession . Few experts now believe that a recession is imminent . ''There's a lot of strength in the economy ,'' said Robert A . Gough x a senior xvice president of Data Resources Inc . x an economic consulting concern in Lexington x Mass . ''We are headed for a 4 percent year . Despite the huge trade deficit and huge Federal budget deficit x we are learning to acclimate .'' Weaker Than Last Year's 6 .8percent Although a 4 percent growth rate is robust compared with most recent performances x as xwell as by European standards x it pales next to last year's 6dot8 percent growth rate . The Administration counts on growth at a rate of almost 4 percent a year through 1990 to trim the record Federal budget deficits . Mr Gough x who believes that the flash estimate will place the growth rate in the 3 1/2 percent to 4 percent range x said that the trade deficit was a wild card that could skew projections . A rising trade deficit x which means that imports are growing more xquick to grow x it could depress the growth of the economy . ''With all the confusing crosscurrents x the strong sector is consumer spending ,'' Michael K . Evans x president of Evans Economics in Washington x said . ''Housing should also rebound x and defense spending is still strong . Capital spending seems weak x so that should show (no) not gain . And x of course x net exports will take us down . When you add those all together x you get about 4 percent growth .'' Did Boom End at Christmas . Michael J . Bazdarich x chief economist of the Claremont Economics Institute in Claremont x Calif . x offered a relatively low estimate of a 3 percent to 3 1/2 percent growth rate for the quarter x in large part because he believes consumer spending is not robust as others think . The economy is still in the lull that began last summer x Mr Bazdarich said . The fourth quarter rebound was helped by heavy spending before Christmas x he said x but that will not rescue the economy this quarter . He said that the strong 1dot4 percent increase in retail sales in February x announced last week x was probably a fluke . Some experts worry that the economy will slow later in the year . The announcement Friday that the nation's industrial production fell five tenths of 1 percent in February further disquieted them and demonstrated the effect of the strong dollar in depressing sectors of the economy that export or that compete with imports . Donald Ratajcak x director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University x predicted a 4 1/2 percent growth rate during the first quarter but added that consumers probably were dipping into savings to achieve that growth . Moreover x slight inventory accumulation might indicate that the long buying spree is slowing . These factors suggest a weakening of the dynamo of the economy x the consumption spending that accounts for two thirds of GNP . Flash Estimate May Be High Lawrence Chimerine x chairman of Chase Econometrics x expects the Government's flash estimate on Wednesday to be between 4 percent and 5 percent . But after the quarter ends March 31 x the figure will be revised downward x he said x because recent statistics on such sectors as the trade deficit are not available . The bright side of all of the forecasts is very low inflation . Almost all experts believe inflation is running at a 4 percent rate or even (less) not x a remarkably low figure compared with recent experience x especially in the third year of an economic expansion x when inflation normally is building . Expectations of low inflation were bolstered by Friday's announcement that producer prices fell one tenth of 1 percent in February . A consequence of the low inflation is that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to adopt a very strict monetary policy that would send the economy tumbling into recession . But the Fed could play an active role . John O . Wilson x senior xvice president and chief economist of the Bank of America in San Francisco x said the Fed was likely to continue to try to ''fine tune'' the economy . In other words x when the economy booms x the Fed will tighten its control of the money supply x which would raise interest rates and suppress growth and inflation . But when the economy is sluggish and appears in danger of tumbling into recession x the Fed will ease its policies and try to prod the economy forward .

"95",53574,"LAST year x the left of center magazine Mother Jones x citing a ''commitment to fairness x product and environmental quality x ethics and people ,'' lauded Worthington Industries Inc . as one of the best companies to work for in America . The reaction of John H . McConnell x the 62 year old founder and chairman of the $700 million steel processing company x was characteristically blunt . ''Who the hell is Mother Jones .'' he asked . That Mr McConnell x a strong proponent of up by your bootstraps capitalism x draws a blank on Mother Jones should come as (no) not surprise . The two are strange bedfellows x united only in their belief in profit sharing as a way to resuscitate American manufacturing . Worthington x which is based in Columbus x Ohio x is one of a handful of large American companies that use profit sharing to account for a major portion x at least 25 percent and in some cases x as high as 50 percent x of employee compensation . Unlike employee stock ownership plans and deferred profit sharing plans x which have (no) not effect on cash compensation x these xpay attention paid to the companies that act xlike that of the Nucor Corporation x the steel mini mill x which pays hefty productivity bonuses . But such plans are not tied to profits . There seems to be (no) not consistent reason why Worthington x Steelcase and Michigan Wheel adopted their profit sharing plans . To the management of some of the companies x it was the morally correct thing to do . To others x it was the best way to insure high productivity and to keep unions out . To one another x it was simply the formalizing of an existing x paternalistic bonus plan . When he started Worthington as a virtual basement operation 31 years ago x Mr McConnell vowed to find a new way to motivate employees and keep unions out of his operations . Having worked in a West Virginia steel mill and an Oldsmobile factory in Michigan x he was appalled by what he said was the way union work rules and poor labor relations sabotaged productivity and profitability . He xquick to employees in quarterly installments . The company has maintained the 17 percent annual payout for each of the past 20 years . In 1985 x profit sharing accounted for about 45 percent of (non) not union employees' annual compensation . It is hard to argue with Worthington's success . Last year x average sales per (non) not union employee (union employees x most of whom came to Worthington when it acquired unionized companies x do not participate in profit sharing) were $353 ,800 x compare xagainst an industry average of 14 .4 percent . With total compensation roughly comparable to that of the auto industry x jobs at Steelcase do not base wages ''somewhat lower than the market ,'' says James C . Soule x xvice president for human resources . ''It allows us wage flexibility to weather bad times . With a variable labor burden x we have been able to discount prices in slack times to take low margin business and keep plants open and people working .'' Steelcase has had only three brief layoffs in its 74 year history . But there is a price to pay for joining the Steelcase ''family .'' Production quotas on some jobs are set at anywhere from a modest 105 percent of day rate standards x the production rate of an average worker as determined by a time study engineer x to a ferocious 200 percent . The average is 130 percent . ''That allows us the luxury of running at full capacity with one third fewer workers ,'' Mr Soule says . ''The pace and pressure is very strong here . A number of people can't deal with the fact that even in Utopia x they have to work .'' However x (less) not 1 percent of Steelcase workers quit or are fired annually . Neither Worthington (nor) not Steelcase had to negotiate with a union when they devised their profit sharing plans . Michigan Wheel x a $20 million x privately held company just down the road from Steelcase x did just that x introducing productivity bonuses in 1946 and profit sharing in 1950 . Today x the 83 year old company's 180 workers derive about 60 percent of their income from monthly productivity bonuses and thrice yearly profit sharing payouts . But there is a more adversarial flavor to labor relations at Michigan Wheel than at Worthington and Steelcase x perhaps because of a strong union presence . Every management decision x including raising prices and hiring new workers x must be xshare of waste . that it reduces the paycheck .''

"101",53836,"A broad spectrum of economists x including advisers to President Reagan x think the nation's unemployment rate can now decline to xaround 5 percent x a level not seen in almost two decades . In the throes of the 1981 82 recession x unemployment exceeded 10 percent x and the economists' new findings do not preclude such levels in future recessions . But in their view x the Government can now let the economy grow for longer than would have been allowed in recent years for fear of inflation . Inflation worries many officials more than unemployment because rising inflation can force the Government to tighten its hold on money x leading to a recession and even higher unemployment . The Traditional Wisdom Since the mid 1970's economists have greeted falling unemployment warily because as it fell x industry would compete for workers x offering higher and higher xpay attention to other economic issues x such as decline to xcool the economy by such means as raising taxes and cutting public spending or by raising interest rates . Starting in 1979 x the Federal Reserve raised rates with a vengeance to exorcise the economy's double digit inflation rate . Now x because of huge changes in the economy's dynamics x notably industry's difficult but ultimately successful absorption of postwar baby boomers and women x economists say that unemployment is settling back toward the low levels of two decades ago and allowing the Government more time before making it necessary to put a damper on things . Disagreement among economists revolves not around whether the rate is decline to xbe 5dot5 percent now . Jeff Faux x head of a liberal research group here known as the Economic Policy Institute x suggested 4 percent . ''But whatever you felt the rate was a few years ago ,'' Mr Faux said x ''you have got to have a lower estimate today .'' Whatever the figure x Mr Sommers urges that the Government not let the rate decline to xthe flashpoint x even if it could be accurately determined . Such a policy driven momentum could inadvertently drive unemployment below that threshold and provoke soaring inflation . Allan H . Meltzer x an economist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh x warned that with the rise of two income families and changing attitudes toward work among young people x making forecasts on the basis of such figures is a risky way to guide economic policy . ''There's (no) not doubt the rate is going down ,'' he said . ''But how much isn't very clear .'' Percentage point distinctions may seem insignificant x but few economic issues arouse social and political passions more than jobs x and even minuscule changes in the unemployment rate reverberate through the economy in striking ways . A Point Equals 1dot2 Million Jobs A reduction of a single point means that 1dot2 million more people are working . Spending by those workers helps keep the economy growing x and the distribution of incomes tends to even out because more of the poor have jobs . Moreover x even many of the poor who are among the least skilled x usually least employable workers x notably black teen agers x are being absorbed . According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics x the unemployment rate for black teen agers has already improved dramatically x from 52 percent five years ago to 29 percent in August x the lowest level in at least a decade . And according to the Congressional Budget Office x a percentage point (less) not unemployment next year would save the Government $36 billion in aid to the jobless x a boon to the drive to reduce the budget deficit . Such a reduction ''is something that I think is good news from nearly any perspective you can imagine ,'' said Edward N . Gramlich x acting director of the Congressional Budget Office . Such economists note one feature of the change x however x that is not welcome . Income gains x adjusted for inflation x have by some measures been eroding and by others are (no) not better than static . Among reasons for stagnant wages x economists say x are the impact of foreign competition and workers' rising emphasis on job security over pay hikes . Reviving a Debate of the 1960's Awareness that a growing economy can tolerate lower unemployment could revive a lively issue of the low inflation 1960's . Economists of the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations became absorbed in debating the level of an unemployment rate that represented the optimum xbalance budget office said x ''the rate rose by more than can be explained by demographics x and it is falling by more than can be explained by demographics .'' ''Why .'' he asked x rhetorically . ''I think it's due to the openness of the economy . We are much more susceptible to foreign competition x especially in large unionized sectors such as steel and autos . It has become impossible for them to engineer the kind of wage increases of former times .'' Thus x he said x the economy and employment can grow with (less) not threat of inflation . With inflation again more subdued x some economists expect the debates of the 1960's to resume in earnest . ''People are going to argue over exactly what level of unemployment is the critical level where inflation accelerates ,'' said Barry P . Bosworth x an economist at the Brookings Institution who was President Carter's chief inflation fighter . Some Favor Unfettered Market Some other economists x mostly conservative x belittle the notion that the Government can manipulate the economy to deliver a predetermined combination of employment and inflation to help encourage growth x and they say unfettered markets do the job better . Just attempting to anticipate a precise level of unemployment is elusive x they say x in part because the labor force is much more fluid than theories of full employment imply . The Bureau of Labor Statistics x the source of employment data x defines the labor force x 122 million of an adult population of 184 million x as people who are working or are prepared to work . The definition excludes the infirm x the retired x society's dropouts x volunteers and those x such as mothers of young children x who elect not take wage paying jobs . But in a booming economy x some of these people trickle back into the labor force x making precise calculations about optimum unemployment difficult . They include the least employable hard core job seekers x such as unskilled youths (without) not high school diplomas and those who are handicapped but willing to work . The Rock Bottom Rate No one x in any event x assumes unemployment can fall to zero . For a while during the 1940's x when the nation xstrain of the labor force who are in transit between jobs x according to Thomas J . Plewes x an associate commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics . Many of the economists who espouse such theories say frictional unemployment x and thus the rock bottom rate x is now around 2 percent .

"112",54570,"EVEN the most enthusiastic admirers in the West of perestroika predicted that the Soviet economy would slow to a crawl while enterprises retooled and learned to fend for themselves in free markets . But through miscalculation or political expediency x Mikhail S . Gorbachev x the Soviet leader x chose to sell the effort to restructure the economy and to reduce rigidity in the Soviet system as painless change . By creating expectations certain to be unfulfilled x he has made reform far more vulnerable to its domestic critics . According to Central Intelligence Agency estimates published last month x the Soviet economy grew at an anemic pace of one half of 1 percent in 1987 . Wages outstripped the production of consumer goods x reportedly stretching the queues outside Soviet stores to record lengths . Stalinist planning served its purpose: Between 1928 and 1955 x Soviet economic growth averaged more than 4 percent annually . But it took a xsavings rate roughly double that of the United States to offset the low productivity of capital allocated from the top . One price of creating a first rate economic power from a centrally planned mold was a third world living standard . In recent years x moreover x the strategy of throwing rubles at the growth problem simply has not worked . By American estimates x the Soviet gross national product grew 2 percent annually from 1975 to 1985 x just half the rate of the previous decade . The Soviet economy did bounce back in 1986 with an estimated 3dot9 percent growth rate x an achievement often credited to Mr Gorbachev's proselytizing in favor of hard work and against hard drink . Much of the improvement x however x can be explained by good weather . Agricultural output increased by 8dot2 percent x while industry showed a gain of just 2dot5 percent . And Herbert Levine x a Soviet specialist at the University of Pennsylvania x argues that some reported successes may have been fabricated by local officials eager to please Moscow . A lot of luck and perhaps a xlittle sleight of hand explain high growth in 1986 . What explains 1987 x a year in which the central plan called for 4dot1 percent growth and Soviet enterprise delivered one eighth of that . Bad weather did hold grain production at 1986 levels and destroyed one third of the fruit crop . But some of the slowdown was directly related to changes intended to revitalize the system . Lacking the yardstick of profit or market determined value of production x Soviet planners have long measured success by the volume of output . Thus industries unrelated to the military have had (little) not incentive to control quality or improve technology . Mr Gorbachev's reflexive solution was not (less) not planning but tougher enforcement . Last year x quality control inspectors were assigned to 1 ,500 enterprises producing 20 percent of Soviet industrial output . To complement the new performance standards x wide scale retooling was ordered for the critical machinery sector . These measures should eventally have a positive impact on output . But the initial effect has been to reduce the flow of finished goods x as factories slow down to meet quality standards or stop altogether to replace obsolete machinery . This year's change x decentralized control for hundreds of enterprises x is a step toward reliance on markets to allocate resources . However x as Jan Vanous of PlanEcon x a Washington consulting firm x points out x the only certain product of this first stage of decentralization is more uncertainty . During the transition x managers will be forced to operate with (neither) not security of guaranteed state financing (nor) not absolute assurance that enterprises will be permitted to pocket the fruits of initiative . Even if decentralization does run smoothly x the benefits will not soon trickle down to ordinary Soviet citizens . With first priority on modernizing basic industry x (little) not left over to expand output of clothes or cars or color television sets . Indeed x in slashing the output of vodka by half since 1984 x Mr Gorbachev left already frustrated consumers with billions more rubles in their pockets and (nothing) not legal to spend them on . If it is so clear that perestroika will take four or five years to show results x why did reformers raise expectations of a costless fix . Why did they leave intact a five year plan whose goals could not possibly be met in a period of transition . Marshall Goldman x associate director of Harvard's Russian Research Center x suggests that what is obvious to Western economists may not obvious to Russians with (no) not training or experience in market based economics . That would explain why so much of the published plan for reform strikes Western analysts as muddled and internally inconsistent . Others argue that Mr Gorbachev understood reform would be difficult but was obliged to dissemble to win over the ruling elite . Whatever the truth x the Soviet leader is left on a precarious perch . His tenure in office may depend on his ability to pacify consumers (without) not sabotaging the experiment with market economics . Copyright 1988 The New York Times Company ","Negative",5174

Flemming x former Secretary of Health x Education and Welfare x asserts that raising the minimum wage by Government fiat actually increases employment more often than not (''Raising Minimum Wage Increases Employment ,'' letter x March 4) x it is fair to assume that he knows whereof he speaks x especially as he concedes that the net gains are usually slight . But his further assertion of the ''need to honor this nation's 50 year contract with the working poor by paying a decent minimum wage now'' raises x and leaves unanswered x questions that had better be faced x and now . True x he leaves (no) not doubt about who is to pay for the higher minimum wage: it is the employer x large or small x and not Government . Are we then to assume that the employer is indeed a party to the contract x or is he or she simply being handed the bill and ordered to pay it . In either case we would better know the true dimensions of the bill . also how the employer can expect to meet it x and with what effect upon the rest of us and the future of this country . Both logic and experience now tell us that any mandated increase in the minimum wage must involve a proportionate rise in the entire wage scale x since all workers insist on maintaining their relative positions on the corporate ladder or the service company's payroll . If x then x the employers are to meet so formidable a charge x what option have they x aside from reducing their corps of workers x except to raise by proportionate amounts the prices they charge their customers x including the working poor . And how long will the wage earner be content if the extra dollars he or she takes home are swallowed up by the rising cost of every purchase . As for the national welfare x our ''50 year contract with the working poor'' has raised the minimum wage from 40 cents to $3 .35 an hour x not counting the $1 ''deficit'' allegedly contributed by our so called creeping inflation since 1981 . In the meantime x consumer prices have risen by a factor of 10 or more x (nor) not end in sight . Dare we then still hope x by legislative fiat x to produce an increase in real wages beginning with the minimum x or is this simply a way of mandating a new inflationary spiral . And if this be so x can we find a way of making it compatible with our declared x if belated and still uncoordinated x efforts to make our American economy once more truly competitive .

"116",54794,"IS the economy on the verge of a recession . There are many straws in the wind x and even some flying rooftops x that suggest that a recession may have already started .

Why x despite the many signs that the economy is weakening x do a large majority of economists foresee (no) not recession . The main reason is that they expect the Federal Reserve to continue easing monetary policy . ''There's (little) not doubt that interest rates will decline to xbecome the scapegoat for a severe economic contraction .'' The monetary authorities have already been supplying more reserves to the banking system x and Stephen H .

''Suppose the Fed were to stay tight ,'' Mr Axilrod said . ''That would almost assuredly precipitate an economic downturn .''

But virtually the entire improvement resulted from a weaker dollar x which raised the dollar value of American corporations' foreign earnings . The danger of too xsteep a fall in the dollar is that it would prevent the Fed from feeding monetary reserves to the economy fast enough x lest the falling dollar cut off foreign investment here . As things stand x Richard B . Hooey x David W . Rolley and Helen Hotchkiss x economists at Drexel Burnham Lambert x see the fundamentals on the dollar turning negative . But they suggest that dollar rallies could emerge from capital flight to the United States ''if events in Eastern Europe are disappointing .'' Is there a chance that eased tensions in Eastern Europe and improved prospects of arms control arrangements might brighten the economic outlook . The reductions in military expenditures would reduce the United States budget deficit enough to permit a greater relaxation of monetary policy x bringing down interest rates and spurring investment x (without) not intensifying inflationary pressures x the optimists say . The drop in the deficit would increase net national savings and trim American dependence on foreign capital inflow . That is a hopeful long term prospect x but it looks premature to expect such an outcome in 1990 . In the context of sluggish economic growth x rising unemployment and recessionary dangers x sharp cuts in military outlays would probably be resisted by both the Administration and Congress .

"119",55061,"IS neglect of the dollar truly benign . Washington's reluctance to tamp down the soaring greenback has been greeted with a xmix with a $160 billion plus deficit on trade and interest payments in 1992 . If the only problem confronting the economy were this external imbalance x the policy prescription would be uncontroversial . Central banks x led by the Fed x would increase the supply of dollars in private hands by purchasing foreign currencies and privately owned Treasury securities . That would undermine the boom in the dollar and perhaps even push its value back to late 1988 levels . But the external imbalance is not only problem x and for many policy makers is not highest priority problem . A tilt toward lower interest rates would feed inflationary pressures . And while these pressures could be offset by a tax increase or Government spending cuts x (neither) not President Bush (nor) not Congress seems inclined to belt tightening . Not everyone agrees that inflation poses a greater threat than the trade imbalance . Three members of the Federal Reserve Board reportedly favor an easing of credit . And Fred Bergsten of the Institute for International Economics believes that the other industrial powers could be persuaded to make a splashy x coordinated assault on the dollar x driving down its value by 20 or 30 percent and putting efforts to eliminate the American current account deficit back on track . There is already evidence x however x that policy makers will simply try to muddle through x teasing the dollar down with low key intervention . Yesterday x Japan's central bank raised its lending rate by three quarters of a percentage point . West Germany may follow . If they are lucky x and set sufficiently modest goals x they may xwell succeed . But contrary to the impression left by eight years of Reaganomics x there is more to competent economic management than ducking the dilemma of the month . Nudging the dollar back into line would not change the fundamentals . The Fed would still be left with the thankless task of coping with multiple economic problems with a single policy instrument . And the trade accounts would remain deeply x seemingly permanently x in the red x leaving economists to ponder the impact of America's accumulating foreign debt on the world order . There is (little) not evidence thus far that debts automatically translate into weakness within the economic alliance . Indeed x Washington has discovered what Walter Russell Mead of the World Policy Institute calls ''debtor power ,'' the leverage that comes with owing so much that creditors dare not present the bill . But Mr Mead is (hardly) not sanguine about the prospects of an economic system led by a profligate giant . The xshort term risk x he notes x is that the allies will manage the trade imbalance with outright protectionism or subtler x equally inefficient market sharing arrangements . The long term threat is a reversal in the trend toward economic integration .

Traders have suggested that high interest rates in the United States and the political turmoil in Japan and West Germany helped the dollar . Traders said the dollar was bolstered yesterday by comments from top Treasury and Federal Reserve officials x who appeared to approve of the higher dollar even as the Fed was intervening to resist the rise . ''We are getting the same old weird x coincidental mixed signals from the Treasury and the Fed ,'' said Ian M . Spence x chief foreign exchange trader at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company . The market often thrives on such policy confusion . Adding to the uncertainity yesterday were comments from a member of the West German central bank x the Bundesbank x who said he opposed the current high level of the dollar . Some Traders See Rift With these comments flashing across their computer screens x it was not long before some traders were talking of the possibility of a policy rift in the Group of Seven x which is made up of the United States and its chief economic allies . Even the talk added to the appetite for dollars as any breach in cooperation would make it more likely that the 1 .90 mark ceiling for the dollar x which the central banks have held for a year x could be broken .

The upward revision in last quarter's GNP . reflected higher Government spending than had been estimated and (less) not business investing . The gains were partly offset by a larger trade deficit as the gap between imports and exports grew at an annual rate of $11 .5 billion during the quarter x the most in more than three years .

''It's much too xpremature to conclude we are heading into a recession ,'' Mr Chimerine said .

The Bush Administration is counting on growth of 3dot2 percent to help it reduce the Federal budget deficit while adhering to the President's campaign pledge of (no) not new taxes . Next month the Government will release its initial estimate for GNP . growth in the first quarter .

As a result x the gap described today by the Congressional office between its deficit estimate and that of the Reagan Administration is likely to apply to the Bush plan as xwell . Possible Difficulties The difference in the estimates could make it more difficult for Congress and the Bush Administration to reach an agreement on reducing the deficit for the fiscal year that begins Oct 1 . If a disagreement persists x the Administration's figure must be the one used to determine if the deficit target of the budget law is met . One of the main reasons the Congressional deficit estimate varies so much from Mr Reagan's is that the Congressional forecast of economic growth x interest rates and inflation in the next fiscal year is much (less) not optimistic . Lower interest rates lead to (less) not spending by the Government to pay for its borrowing x and greater economic growth leads to increased revenue from higher tax payments .

Last year x some members of our budget staff x thinking that they were helping me x made such a proposal . I thought it was a terrible idea and immediately buried it . I wish the City Council had let it rest in peace .  New York is the cultural capital of the world xfair xshare have the capacity to process $68 million xworth of contracts each year with the arts organizations of our city . Let us remember that the Federal contribution to our city's budget has been cut in half over the last 10 years . Those funds would have covered almost our entire budget gap this year . To break up the Department of Cultural Affairs and to scatter the pieces among other agencies would cripple our ability to fulfill our cultural dreams when our city is flush again . The long range interests of the city x and the arts community x are best served with a strong x energized and unthreatened Department of Cultural Affairs .

"135",56117,"AMERICA is in a sour mood . The unemployment rate is rising x the Index of Leading Economic Indicators is slipping x and everyone seems to be thoroughly disgusted with the powers that be x including Congress and x increasingly x the White House . It should be a dream scenario for Democrats x who have been shut out of the Presidency for more than a decade and who x until recently x had been all but counted out of the race again in 1992 . Instead x there is a sort of low grade policy panic setting in as elected officials of both parties seek to gauge the depth of the public's anger and formulate a palatable and convincing set of solutions .  Both parties are struggling under the weight of the recession x which has added a slate of economic woes to the general disenchantment with Washington's brand of insider politics that first began to make itself felt during the 1990 midterm elections . But the discontent is more complex than the polls can convey . Across the country x the xsense that the nation is on the edge of bad times colors daily life . In the Midwest x farmers who have saved and worked hard for years remain uneasy that everything they have gained could slip away at any moment . In New Hampshire x the first primary state x workers are striking at paper mills and knitwear factories .

"137",56142,"For seven consecutive years beginning in 1983 x the celebrated American economic expansion brought disappointing results in the fight against poverty x defying historical experience and leaving the country with poverty rates unusually high among prosperous Western nations . The question has been why .  In recent months x two academic studies have addressed that question and come to an unsettling conclusion: America has high poverty rates not because it must x but because it chooses to . Comparing the United States with selected Western European countries and Canada x the studies contend that with compare xagainst poverty . Contending that the United States needs to spend more and design its programs better x he advocates a system of national health xcare x a program that guarantees child xsupport for single parents and universal cash payments to families with children . He also calls for an expanded program of unemployment benefits and for more Government day xcare . I think it's hokum x said Douglas Besharov x a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute x a Washington research xorganized by encouraging more dependency . Liberals always say x 'Gee x if we could only do it as xwell as the Europeans ,' he said . But the problem is we don't have the same kind of poor people . Our problem is with poor people who don't work . Legislation Is Considered  The debate over the European experience comes as American poverty rates x stubbornly high even during a time of national prosperity x are once again on a recession driven rise x and some lawmakers are urging variations of Western European solutions . Among the European style policies being considered by Congress are variations on a national system of health xcare x and proposals to provide cash allowances to families with children . The United States is the only Western industrialized nation (without) not child allowance policy x said Senator John D . Rockefeller 4th x a West Virginia Democrat who is pushing such plans . And it shows . Lawrence Mead x a political scientist at New York University x said the timing of these proposals was disturbing since they came as some Western European countries were cutting back x for fear that they were producing dependency . In Europe x you are beginning to see an ethnically and behaviorally distinct underclass x he said . Mr Smeeding contended that in the mid 1980's x market forces alone produced a similar amount of poverty here and in the other countries he studied: Canada x Australia x Sweden x Germany x the Netherlands x France x and Britain . But he said that huge differences emerge when Government programs are counted . Ambitious social programs in the other countries eliminated about three quarters of their poverty x Mr Smeeding said x but social policy in this country reduced poverty by only about one third . After Government programs are counted x the poverty rate of 10 .9 percent for the American elderly was nearly four times the average rate in the other countries x he said . The poverty rate of 20 .4 percent for American children was about three times as high . Amid this debate x there is substantial agreement that economic growth alone is (less) not prescription for fighting poverty than it used to be . Liberals tend to emphasize changes in the economy that have depressed wages for the least skilled workers . Conservatives emphasize the fail to xseek work . In the second new study x comparing the two longest economic expansions in modern American history x Rebecca M . Blank x an economist at Northwestern University x documented the change in the ability of economic growth to reduce poverty . During the longest expansion x from 1961 to 1970 x the percentage of Americans living in poverty dropped 9dot6 points x to 12 .6 percent . During the second longest expansion x from 1983 to 1989 x the drop was slight by comparison x a 2dot4 point dip to 12 .8 percent . Had the same correlation held true between economic growth and the reduction of poverty x Ms Blank said x the 1989 poverty rate would have been 9dot3 percent x meaning that 8dot7 million fewer Americans would have lived in poverty . Trickle down did not work in the 1980's as xwell as it did in the 1960's x she said . Ms Blank attributed the difference to a collapse in wages for the lowest paid workers . Comparing the United States with Canada x Ms Blank found that similar economic trends held true in both countries for the past decade but that Canada's poverty rates fell much faster . Examining data for 1986 x Ms Blank found that market forces alone left 17 .5 percent of Canadians poor . But once welfare assistance and other Government programs were counted x the rate fell to 11 .8 percent . By contrast x the United States started out with (less) not poverty but wound up with more: market forces produced a poverty rate of 15 .5 percent x but Government programs cut that figure (little) not x to 13 .6 percent . The difference is almost entirely due to Canada's more generous public assistance program x she said . Ms Blank relied on the official American definition of poverty x which is based on a minimal food budget and is updated every year for inflation . In 1990 x for example x a family of four was considered poor if it received (less) not $13 ,359 . To arrive at the Canadian poverty figures x she simply converted the thresholds into Canadian currency . Method of Study Attacked  Some American conservatives are sharply critical of this method x saying it exaggerates the extent of American poverty since it does not count Government programs that provide noncash benefits like subsidized housing x food stamps and medical xcare . Analyzing previously unavailable figures from Western Europe x Mr Smeeding found similar patterns . He said other countries started with comparable or even higher amounts of poverty than the United States x but used policy much more effectively in reducing it . On average in the mid 1980's x the economies of the countries he studied produced a poverty rate of 22 .4 percent . But after social programs were counted x that figure fell to 5dot9 percent . The drop was much more modest in the United States x falling from 19 .9 percent before Government assistance to 13 .3 percent after it . Mr Smeeding defined as poor any household receiving (less) not 40 percent of that nation's median income x a measure that he said approximated the United States standard . He did not count noncash benefits . Mr Besharov said Mr Smeeding's definition of poverty was meaningless . Given differences in international standards of living x he said x someone defined as poor in America may in fact have more material goods than French or Swedes who are not considered poor . Most of all x Mr Besharov questioned the idea that European solutions could be imported (without) not producing harmful side effects . For instance x he contended that in most European countries there were strong social pressures for teen agers not babies . He said European countries could therefore provide more money to single mothers x with fewer fears that they would increase teen age pregnancy . If the United States gave single young mothers more money x he argued x it might just get more single young mothers . We are a much freer society x he said . Mr Smeeding argued that the differences between the societies was not large as Mr Besharov said and that policies should be modified for an American context . What he's saying is that all international comparisons are illegitimate x Mr Smeeding said . I just don't agree . Copyright 1991 The New York Times Company ","Negative",7628
"138",56243,"The Nynex Corporation announced yesterday that it had reached an unusual mid contract accord with its unions in an effort to (avoid) not another strike like one in 1989 x the industry's longest and most bitter since the breakup of AT and T . In the new labor accord x the first of its kind in the telecommunications industry x Nynex is giving pay increases of 13 percent over the next three years . That compares with a 9dot2 percent wage rise in the 1989 three year contract and 10 .3 percent in a 1986 agreement .  Negotiated 11 months before the old Nynex contract was to expire x the new pact could provide a model for the Baby Bell companies and their unions as those contracts expire next year . 7 Previous Strikes  All of the Baby Bells are heavily unionized . There have been seven strikes at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the Baby Bells since the 1984 breakup . Six lasted (less) not month x but the seventh x the 1989 Nynex strike x lasted more than four months . Nynex's revenue growth has slowed as the recession hurt white collar employment x and that decline to xreduce by 5 percent its 32 ,000 management workers through voluntary transfers x retirements or separations and then x if necessary x involuntary separations . First Manager Layoffs  Kenneth M . Leon x an analyst at Bear x Stearns who follows Nynex x noted that the reductions represented the first time Nynex had sought to lay off managers x a sign that the Northeastern recession was still battering New York Telephone and New England Telephone . Normally x I would regard the Nynex labor agreement as positive x Mr Leon said . But this is far from conclusive . It's not clear whether these moves will generate profits x and the recession may dim any luster of this accord . Nynex estimates the cost of the new contract at $240 million x compared with $180 million for the old one . The Nynex agreement is likely be sent in early October to members of the Communications Workers of America x Nynex's principal union x and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers . Contracts for nearly a half million workers at AT and T . x GTE and the six other Baby Bells expire next year . News of the Nynex accord was announced on Friday x but (no) not details were given then . The preliminary reaction from other unions over the weekend has been positive x a Communications Workers spokesman said . In Englewood x Colo . x U S West x another Baby Bell company x reacted favorably to the early conclusion of labor talks x but said it was not familiar with the details of the talks . Over all x it's a positive development x said Debra L . Thomas x a spokeswoman for U S West . That company had a seven day strike in 1986 . Cost of Living Provision  In the new Nynex accord x union members may also get a modest cost of living adjustment in 1994 if inflation cumulatively exceeds 9 percent for two years x as xwell as preserving the health benefits that were the central dispute in 1989 . Nynex is also giving pension enhancements x which would provide the early retirement for thousands of workers that some union employees had sought x while helping to trim the ranks of older workers x whose pay and benefits are more expensive . The Baby Bells have been hit by slow growth in recent years in the majority of their business x telephone conversations . Last year x Nynex x the second largest Baby Bell x after BellSouth x posted revenue of $13 .6 billion x up about 20 percent since 1986 x or (less) not 4 percent annually for the last five years . Profits last year totaled $949 million x down 22 percent from 1986 x or an annual decline of about 4 percent . Nynex has said the main reason for the profit drop is high costs x including labor . Covers 57 ,000 Workers  The agreement announced yesterday extends until August 1995 a three and a half year accord that would have expired in August 1992 . It covers 57 ,000 telephone technicians x installers x operators x repair workers and others . About 60 ,000 workers walked off the job in the 1989 labor dispute x but Nynex has since accepted the early retirement or not filled the jobs of 3 ,000 workers for a shrinage of the labor force of about 5 percent .

"139",56252,"In a heartening report on inflation x prices at the producer level rose two tenths of 1 percent in August x a modest increase caused mainly by higher oil prices that have since subsided x Labor Department figures showed today . The report x which was somewhat better than expected x touched off a rally in the market for fixed income securities as investors and traders viewed it as increasing the chances of a new and prompt easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve . The economy would benefit from additional monetary stimulation x and there's very (little) not chance of stirring up inflation by doing so x asserted Ron Schreibman x xvice president of the National Association of Wholesaler Distributors . The trade group's members closely follow the Producer Price Index since it reflects transactions with their suppliers . Expectations of the Fed  The Federal Reserve generally seeks to (avoid) not appearing to respond to any particular piece of economic news but analysts said today that the next x long anticipated round of rate cuts could come at any time . On Friday morning the Government is to publish its comprehensive report on retail sales during August and on inflation at the consumer level . Both are expected to reflect sluggish economic conditions . This prepares the way some more for the Fed to ease x said Samuel D . Kahan x chief financial economist for Fuji Securities in Chicago . Comparing a cut in xshort term rates to an apple fully ripened on a tree x he said x Today x tomorrow x we know it's going to fall xwell as energy x also rose two tenths of 1 percent in August . This was the same pace as in July and in May x with June unchanged . The Labor Department revised downward today the pace of inflation it reported earlier for April and May . Of further encouragement to analysts was the fact that the producer price indexes for goods at the intermediate and crude stages of production were also held in check . Intermediate goods rose four tenths of 1 percent over all x but just one tenth (without) not energy . crude goods were unchanged over all x but 1dot1 percent lower (without) not energy .

In this case x a bolt of cloth would be the intermediate good and the raw cotton or wool the crude good . 'Inflation Is Under Control'  These figures conclusively demonstrate that inflation is under control x said Jerry Jasinowski x president of the National Association of Manufacturers x noting that core inflation at the producer level has remained at about 2dot5 percent since February . The 1dot8 percent jump in finished energy prices last month x which included a decline in residential xnatural gas x was significantly offset by a four tenths of 1 percent decline in consumer foods . Beef and veal fell 4dot7 percent x and prices also fell for fish x fresh and processed fruits and vegetables x soft drinks and pork . But passenger cars and tobacco prices both advanced 1dot1 percent as did women's apparel x household appliances x prescription drugs x glassware and textbooks . Automobile prices fell four tenths of 1 percent before seasonal adjustment . Prices for Manufacturers  Among intermediate goods x materials for nondurable manufacturing x like paint and chemicals x rose three tenths of 1 percent x the first increase for this category since November x the report showed . Materials for durable manufacturing x like copper and brass mill shapes x fell seven tenths of 1 percent following a one tenth of 1 percent decline in July .

We talked about many programs x but we have lose the xearly months of the recession .

"142",56745,"The mighty California economy is stumbling x marking the delayed arrival of the national recession on the West Coast and prompting concern that the state's downturn could outlast the slump in the rest of the country . The nation's most populous state is being battered on many fronts . The unemployment rate has jumped in the last six months x to 7 percent x from 5dot1 percent in June . That is xwell above the national average of 6dot2 percent and leaves California with the third highest rate of joblessness among the big industrial states . Economists expect additional layoffs in important industries like construction and aerospace x both of which are slumping badly .  Housing starts fell 31 percent last year (figures for January are not available) x and home prices continue to drop in many areas . Agriculture x the largest single component of the state's economy x is reeling from a freeze earlier this winter that killed many of crops and from a five year drought that has necessitated stringent plans for water rationing . All told x gross state product x or total output of goods and services x is expected to decline to xthe Business Forecasting Project at the University of California at Los Angeles . And with tax receipts leveling off and outlays continuing to rise x the state government faces a deficit of nearly $2 billion out of a budget of $54 billion for the fiscal year that will end on June 30 . The deficit will be at least $5 billion for the next fiscal year . Many Californians had come to believe that their state x by virtue of its economic diversity x would be recession resistant if not recession proof . Indeed x California still has many powerful factors in its favor x including its position as the hub of trade with Asia and its leading positions in technology x manufacturing and agriculture . Nevertheless x the recession that the state has slipped into in recent months is by some measures x including unemployment and housing starts x worse than the one being suffered by the rest of the nation . Some economists think the slump here will be hard to shake . 'Fairly Spectacular' Slide  California's economy held up longer than the US as a whole x but we had a fairly spectacular downward slide here in 1990 x led by housing and aerospace x said David G . Hensley x an economist who heads the Business Forecasting Project at the University of California at Los Angeles . Mr Hensley said that in addition to suffering all of the broad economic problems of the national economy x California would be hurt by factors peculiar to the state . Most notable of these x he said x are the drought and the decline to xease soon x he said . You could make a fairly convincing case that we are going to have more trouble than the US as a whole x Mr Hensley said .

"143",56882,"Amid a xgreat deal of publicity x and several false calls x the recession has finally arrived . But by all accounts it is not typical recession x (nor) not it pronounced in the typical way . The seven member Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research normally makes its dour recession confirmation only after two quarters of a downturn in the gross national product have been observed .  This time x by traditional standards x the committee's call was early . The Commerce Department's figures x which are complete only through the end of the third quarter of 1990 x still show growth . Even so x it was the right call x said Donald Ratajczak x director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University in Atlanta . The recession began in the fourth quarter of last year . That's the consensus forecast . Who says we economists can't agree . According to Mickey D . Levy x chief economist at CRT Government Securities x most recessions start after prices begin to rise and the Federal Reserve Board raises interest rates to dampen inflation . Then the Fed opens the floodgates x which ends the recession but reignites inflation x he said . But this time x according to Mr Levy x Alan Greenspan x chairman of the Federal Reserve x has been far more prudent . In the midst of a slowdown x monetary policy remains fairly tight .  This recession is also different in the way it is inflicting its pain on thecountry . Typically x recessions begin in the manufacturing sector and later spread to the services . But this time x one of the few bright spots in the economy has been export oriented manufacturing . Services x especially financial and retail services x have been the hardest hit .  Banks x savings and loans x Wall Street firms and even law firms are hurting . Layoffs from the financial and retail sectors are rising . Sears x Roebuck and Citicorp x the nation's largest retailer and bank x have both been thinning their ranks . There is a tremendous restructuring going on in the service producing industries x said Mr Levy .  As a result x the healthiest regions of the country are those with heavy concentrations of export oriented industries x the Midwest and Northwest . At the other extreme x the weakest region is the Northeast . This is exactly the opposite of the pattern observed during the last recession in 1982 .  Inventory accumulation is another indicator that is behaving differently from the past . Generally x inventories rise significantly when times are tough and goods remain unsold . But so far in this downturn x inventories have remained remarkably flat . New methods x like just in time inventory management x more outsourcing and ordering goods closer to the time of sale x have enabled companies to operate in a leaner fashion . Housing starts x on the other hand x are doing the traditional thing x falling . In the Northeast and West x housing starts and sales are already down to levels not seen since the last recession x in 1982 .  Then there was Iraq's invasion of Kuwait . The subsequent oil price jump added to inflation and took more money from consumers' pockets . This slowed a weakened economy even more . And if there is a war x long or short x its effects on the economy are too xuncertain to predict . MICKEY D . LEVY  Chief economist at CRT Government Securities in New York City .  The current recession is merely a correction that will wring out a decade of excesses from the economy x according to Mr Levy . As this happens x inflation will fall and prices will adjust downward . Real estate prices will continue to fall as unsold inventories of commercial property are cleared . But the recession will not deep . Instead x there will be the long sought soft landing in the first half of the year . The second half will begin a slow but steady recovery . While the service sector will be hurt by the downturn x the manufacturing sector will be helped by continued growth in exports . Because of its export orientation x the Midwest and Northwest will outperform the rest of the economy . Even though the Federal Reserve has eased somewhat on interest rates and on the reserve requirements for certain types of bank deposits x Mr Levy believes it will continue to follow a relatively restrictive policy . Mr Greenspan has done an excellent job managing the economy x Mr Levy said . DONALD RATAJCZAK  Director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University in Atlanta .  Mr Ratajczak thinks the recession will be a xlittle deeper x but shorter than average . The recession started in the forth quarter of 1990 x he said . It will have a duration of 8 to 10 months . In the first half of the year x unemployment is likely to rise to 7 percent and then drift upward to 7 .25 percent before coming down in 1992 . The fear of war and the reluctance of consumers to spend has put the brakes on the economy . These two factors particularly hurt the housing and construction sectors . Exports have also been affected because much of Europe has been slowed by the fear of war and of a subsequent disruption of its oil supply .

Small business owners are the backbone of many neighborhoods in New York City x and they need to be preserved . Increases in commercial real estate assessments x escalating rents and crime are making them an endangered species . Commercial strips throughout the city are seeing an increase in small business turnover and are concerned about eventual vacancies . The neighborhoods in the outer boroughs rely on commercial strips as a measure of a neighborhood's vitality . A faltering commercial strip is usually the first sign of an eroding neighborhood . Commercial real estate assessments must be brought down to realistic levels x so that small business owners can survive this crisis . Many small business owners are commercial tenants and have long term leases with property owners . Many of these leases stipulate that the commercial tenant pay the real estate tax x exclusive of the rent .

"148",57169,"YOU can't sell it if you don't have it x even if you are willing to cut the price . And when it comes to manufactured goods x you have to make them to sell them . The employment report for August was a disaster from every perspective save that of the bond traders x who figured that the Federal Reserve would push interest rates lower x as it promptly did  . Much will be made of the fact that the private sector has 38 ,000 fewer employees now than in January 1989 x when President Bush took office .  But it is in manufacturing jobs that the sad story of America's slide as an industrial giant has been written . The number of such jobs has fluctuated within a relatively narrow band for the past two decades . In recessions x lots get laid off . In recoveries x a few get rehired . Back in 1979 x a record 21 million people worked in manufacturing in this country . By the end of 1982 x recession had cut that figure to 18 million . During the much vaunted recovery of the 1980's x it was (never) not back above 19 .5 million . Now it is at 18 .15 million x just a couple of ticks from setting a 27 year low . In his speech to the Republican National Convention x President Bush vowed that the United States would be an export superpower x but the Administration's strategy x if it has one x is not clear . It did boost subsidized agricultural exports last week x but in manufactured goods the plan seems to be to let the dollar slide far enough to make prices competitive . That's where the catch comes in . The low dollar has made it prohibitively expensive for Americans to travel overseas x and it has aided exports for those companies that make internationally traded products . But the worry is that the manufacturing base in this country has shrunken so much that exports can (never) not rise to the levels needed to offset the current levels of imports . The decline to xexplain the rise in poverty in this country . Historically x manufacturing offered reasonably good jobs to relatively uneducated workers . Now x a generation has grown up with (no) not expansion in the manufacturing sector . In sum x the bad news in the employment report is not cyclical x that the recovery from the recession is hard to find . There is also a secular trend x in which service jobs have increased x particularly in government employment . When President Reagan took office x there were 25 percent more Americans working in manufacturing than in civilian government jobs . Last October x for the first time ever x government employment outstripped manufacturing x and now there are 554 ,000 more people working for governments .

"149",57293,"Democrats hate to admit it x but Bill Clinton sometimes sounds like Ronald Reagan x especially when he says that the economy can grow its way out of the budget deficit . Bush partisans who deride Governor Clinton's economic program often sound the way Democrats did when they questioned whether the tax cuts of President Reagan's first term would reduce the Federal deficit .  But appearances can be deceiving . When the Arkansas Governor and apparent Democratic Presidential nominee calls not for tax cuts but for more spending on public investment x he sounds far more xlike a Roosevelt Democrat than a Reagan Republican . Mr Clinton's advisers acknowledge that their plan relies heavily on economic growth . But they assert that their focus on increasing investment will serve as an engine for growth that will in turn increase tax revenue x reduce poverty and cut the demand for social programs like food stamps . All this x they say x will serve to lower the deficit . $200 Billion Public Investment The heart of the Clinton plan is spending $200 billion over four years on public investment: building xhigh speed railroads and a national computernetwork and improving education and job training . This x his advisers say x will increase productivity by three tenths of a percent a year . They decline to xestimate how much it will spur growth . Indeed x what comes through strongest in speaking to Mr Clinton and his advisers is their conviction that enhancing investment is a more urgent priority than cutting the deficit . And while insisting that he remains committed to eliminating the deficit x Mr Clinton said the economic plan he unveiled on June 21 x was influenced by 100 leading economists x including six Nobel laureates x who signed a letter urging the Government to spend $50 billion a year on investments to speed economic growth . In the absence of increasing investment in this country x including public investment x you can't get growth going again x Mr Clinton said . There is an undeniable adroitness to Mr Clinton's economic plan x just as there was to President Reagan's . Mr Reagan's arguments that tax cuts would increase growth and Government revenue dovetailed perfectly with conservative dogma . And Mr Clinton's contention that beefed up public investment will produce growth and a lower deficit dovetails neatly with Democratic beliefs . The new Clinton plan has drawn plenty of Republican fire x with Vice President Dan Quayle lambasting it as just another tax and spend Democratic proposal that fail to xdiscipline spending . He said the plan does not possible savings from reining in health xcare costs because he is still working on a comprehensive health plan .

But with the latest polls showing that 78 percent of registered voters disapprove of President Bush's economic performance x it is plain that Americans aren't listening . Why x then x is candidate Bush confining his economic maneuvers to jawboning the Federal Reserve for easier credit . The short answer is that even if Washington had the will to stimulate the economy xquick to stay lean x the benefits are barely xtrickling down: Robert Reischauer of the Congressional Budget Office reports that we are only doing a xlittle better than treading water in the job creation department . The obvious conclusion x a hindsight special x is that the President blew it .

All this assumes that Congressional Democrats could have been persuaded to save President Bush's bacon x and that the fiscal hawks to the President's right would have gone along with a bigger deficit . It also assumes that the economy would have responded according to Hoyle . Would consumers have rushed to spend the tax windfall . Would businesses have rushed after them x expanding capacity and rebuilding depleted inventories . Perhaps . But it is also possible that a temporary break with budget discipline would have been widely interpreted as a permanent break . And this would probably have generated expectations of higher inflation x raising long term interest rates and fears of a monetary crunch down the road . Treasury Secretary Nicholas F . Brady x whose friendship with the President reportedly gives him enormous influence over policy x has argued that tax and spending measures would have had (less) not zero effect x frightening business so much that total private spending would have fallen . A safer route to re election bliss might have been through more aggressive expansion of the money supply . And indeed x the President is now making (no) not secret of his irritation with the Fed's caution . But herextoo x there were potholes galore .

"157",57604,"With the latest statistics showing surprising economic strength x credit market participants are challenging the view held by most economists that any recovery will be mild at most . The reports x particularly the spurt in retail sales reported for January and February x have caused many economists to ratchet up their growth forecasts for the first half of the year . It now appears x they say x that the economy is likely to expand slightly in the first quarter instead of contracting . And the boost to consumption provided by the retail sales numbers suggests that second quarter growth should be around 2 percent or perhaps a bit higher .  But if the rise in interest rates this winter is indicative of market expectations x traders see those forecasts as overly pessimistic . Higher Pricing of Debt  Instead of 1 percent to 2 percent growth x market participants have priced debt securities at levels consistent with an economy expanding at a 3 percent to 4 percent rate x analysts said . While that higher level would be about half the rate of expansion at the end of earlier post World War II recessions x most economists say even that sort of pace will not reached this year x particularly on a sustained basis . There is the potential for stronger than expected growth x said Gary Schlossberg x a xvice president and senior economist at Wells Fargo and Company in San Francisco . But I think it will be more modest than the bond market currently expects and that interest rates will move back down . Consumers Still Stymied  Even though the rise in spending pushed retail sales to their highest level in nearly two years on an inflation adjusted basis in January and February x a now familiar litany of constraints made it hard to see how much extra push to the recovery consumers can provide . Outstanding consumer debt and debt service have fall xwell above historic norms . Meanwhile x growth in personal income remains sluggish x though analysts said that mortgage refinancings and larger tax refunds might have improved cash flows in January and February and could help explain why spending picked up in those months . Need for More Jobs  Consumer confidence is showing some improvement asxwell but weekly initial unemployment claims continue to run at recessionxlike levels . And with factories operating at xwell under peak capacity x employers are more likely to have their existing work force put in longer hours to meet any increase in output for some months before they start hiring again . Without an increase in jobs x the recent growth in cash flows will not sustained x Paul D . Mastroddi x an economist at Morgan Guaranty Trust Company x wrote in the bank's weekly letter to clients . Thomas Synnott x chief economist and senior xvice president at the United States Trust Company x said x With initial unemployment claims still running at 450 ,000 a week x we are not poised for a big turn in the economy . Low inflation x the prospects for a mild recovery and the weakness of private demand for credit all argue for lower interest rates than we have today x Mr Synnott added x with the possible exception of the overnight Federal funds rate . The credit markets usually warm to indications of a weak economy and mild inflation pressures because lower inflation tends to increase the value of fixed income securities . Little Has Changed of Late  Little has changed over the last few months to stir expectations of much stimulus from other sectors of the economy x analysts argue . Prospects that the President and Congress will agree to a substantive fiscal package are dwindling x Susan Hering x an economist at Salomon Brothers x said .

"158",57651,"To the Editor: Milton Friedman credits the Reagan Administration's economic policies with the expansion of the 1980's in Oovood Economics (Op Ed x Feb 2) x but he neglects some consequences of those policies . Mr Friedman's four planks of Reaganomics x lower tax rates x restraint in Government spending x deregulation and a strict monetary policy x must bear a xresponsib for the recession .  The results of Reaganomics contradict Mr Friedman's claim that Reducing revenue available to Congress is the only effective way to limit spending . The Reagan tax cuts reduced Government revenue x yet Government spending grew . The national debt tripled from $1 trillion to $3 trillion in the eight Reagan years . Mr Friedman acknowledges that Government spending rose as a fraction of income until 1985 x but then dismisses this because Government spending as a fraction of income fell slightly after 1985 . This is analogous to paying $10 ,000 for a car with a $1 ,000 rebate x and then viewing it as if you had been given a car and $1 ,000 x ignoring the $9 ,000 you paid . What Mr Friedman muddles is that Government spending as a fraction of income rose under Ronald Reagan . If the deregulation of the Reagan years is a success x the deregulation must also take xresponsib for the $500 billion taxpayer bailout of fail to xquestion his perspective . Mr Friedman is probably surviving the recession nicely x with a secure job and comfortable life style . Millions of unemployed Americans would beg to differ about the severity of the recession . These Americans x whom Mr Friedman feels safe in neglecting x will decide the future course of the country in the November election . Mr Friedman has made valuable contributions to economic thought . However x if he gives Reaganomics credit for the expansion of the 80's and ignores the huge deficits that fueled the expansion x he is letting his political inclinations interfere with the science he has spent his life studying . If we give Reaganomics credit for the boom of the 80's x we also must acknowledge that those policies laid the groundwork for this recession and weakened our economic base .

"172",58530,"The leaders of 18 nations who gathered this week at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Indonesia arrived with lofty talk of achieving a sweeping agreement to stimulate economic growth on the Pacific Rim x already among the most vibrant economic regions in the world . Their final communique enshrines a noble objective: xfree trade and investment by the year 2020 . Unfortunately x the APEC pledge fail to xinclude a single substantive measure . The easy task is to commit to a vague goal a quarter century away . The hard task x apparently too xhard x is to take concrete measures that would challenge entrenched interests in each country .  The APEC countries call for xfree trade x but do not say if that includes services as xwell as manufactured goods . The participants call on APEC's industrialized members to achieve xfree trade 10 years earlier than the 2020 target for everyone x but does not say which countries would be included in the fast lane . Does that leave South Korea or China x for example x in or out . Underlying the fail to xproduce a detailed agreement are fundamental differences among the group's members . The United States and Australia are both enthusiastic proponents of xfree trade x in part because both feared that the East Asian members might move (without) not them . But Malaysia and others oppose xfree trade to varying degrees . Their problem arises in part from the fact that international trade rules x with one exception x prevent countries from extending preferential trade to each other unless they also extend it to every other trading xpartner . The exception applies only to countries that move all the way toward forming a xfree trade bloc x like the North American Free Trade Agreement between Mexico x the US and Canada . The Asia Pacific countries know that Congress is not about to approve another Nafta x especially if it includes low wage bastions like Malaysia and Indonesia x (without) not insisting upon rules about environmental protection and working conditions . That prospect scares many APEC countries out of tying themselves closely to the US in a xfree trade zone . The conference postponed dealing with fundamental difficulties like these for at least a year . Even though it could not create a xfree trade zone overnight x the APEC gathering could have made progress in specific areas . For example x the countries considered x but fail to xadopt x a code to open up borders to foreign investors . The trick for APEC is to turn the virtuous pledge into real progress . That will require aggressive action on small measures that would knock down tariff and (non) not tariff barriers . Free trade among Pacific Rim countries could then become something more than rhetoric . TYPE: Editorial Copyright 1994 The New York Times Company ","Negative",2817

"174",58773,"The continued fall of the dollar in international currency markets today put new pressure on the Federal Reserve to consider a fifth interest rate increase this year x as stock markets dropped sharply around the world . Even though Federal Reserve officials were unwilling to say so publicly today x they have privately signaled this spring their willingness to stop any steep slumps in the dollar's value by raising xshort term interest rates again x even if that further slows the pace of American economic growth .  Their recent comments that inflation was under control always carried the caveat that all bets were off if a new threat appeared x notably a drop in the value of the dollar or a big jump in commodity prices . The choice between the domestic economy's xshort term health and helping the dollar with higher interest rates is a staple of economic textbooks . For the Federal Reserve x such a choice is particularly painful now . After its fourth increase in xshort term interest rates in as many months x the Federal Reserve said in May that it had substantially completed its current round of interest rate increases . It's a bad dream x said John H . Makin x a resident economist at the American Enterprise Institute x a Washington research xorganized by the Bundesbank in Germany x have proved (less) not willing to reduce interest rates than many investors had expected . This has made the German mark more attractive to investors seeking higher interest rates and the dollar x by default x (less) not attractive . Even if the dollar continues to fall x economists at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere disagree about the precise effects on inflation . Only a third to two fifths of the American economy consists of goods subject to international competition . Many industries x from residential construction to medical xcare and other services x are virtually immune to international competition . Their prices presumably would be (little) not affected by how much it costs to build a house in Hamburg or to have a sprained ankle treated in Osaka .

"175",58901,"Though Canada may deserve plaudits for its low inflation rate x a plummeting Canadian dollar has forced interest rates higher x threatening recovery from the double digit unemployment lingering after the country's most severe recession since World War II . The currency's dive to its lowest point in almost eight years mainly reflects growing nervousness over the Canadian Government's ability to control the ballooning public debt .  The risk of secession by Quebec is also rattling foreign investors . If separatists x whom polls now strongly favor x win province elections this year x there is concern that they could persuade a majority of Quebecers to say yes to sovereignty for the province in a referendum . Bank Economist Is Vexed  Canada's chronic dependence on foreign capital to finance bloated payment shortfalls leaves the financial markets very exposed to sudden shifts in investor confidence x said Aron Gampel assistant chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia . On Monday x the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar fell to 71 .60 cents x its lowest point relative to American currency since August 1986 . It recovered slightly today to 72 .34 cents x still about 3 cents below its value at the beginning of March . By contrast x the Canadian dollar was worth nearly 90 cents at the end of 1991 . As a result x interest rates x including those for mortgages and installment payments for cars and home appliances x have jumped one to two percentage points since early March . Although rates have also climbed in the United States x the rise has been more dramatic in Canada because it depends more on foreign capital to finance its deficits . As a percentage of the xgross domestic product x both the xbalance budget deficits in Canada are running twice as high as comparable American deficits . Canada's reliance on foreign borrowing x chiefly from the United States x to finance national health x unemployment insurance and other domestic programs has caused the level of foreign debt to rise two and a half times since the early 1980's . Foreign debt stood at 252 .8 billion Canadian dollars by the end of 1993 x representing 8 ,792 .61 Canadian dollars for every person in this country x more than three times the American foreign debt on a per capita basis . Canada has one of the lowest inflation rates in the world . At 1dot8 percent x it is half that of the United States . Yet Canadians x saddled with their huge debt x which is now raising questions of creditworthiness x must pay one to two percentage points more to borrow money than Americans . Many critics blame the Liberal Government's budget x announced by Finance Minister Paul Martin on Feb 22 . for the lack xin xdefense x which is not big consumer of Canadian dollars . Sherry Cooper x chief economist at the investment firm of Burns x Fry x echoing the view of many on Bay Street x Toronto's and Canada's financial center x said the currency weakness is reflective of a lose the xforeign currency debt from AAA . Moody's Investors Service still regards all Canadian Government debt as triple A . The higher interest rates needed to attract money from abroad compound the problems of reducing the deficit and put a brake on consumption x which could derail Canada's fragile economic recovery . The five month old Liberal Cabinet had counted on economic growth to put Canadians back to work . Although by economists' measurements x the recession officially ended in 1992 x Canada still has more than 11 percent unemployment x compared with 6dot5 percent in the United States . A positive element is the help that the cheaper Canadian dollar is giving to exports x especially goods sold in the United States .

Direction Is Unclear  Alan Blinder x a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers x said Mr Clinton was referring to long term interest rates x which averaged 8 .29 percent for 30 year Treasury bonds at the bottom of the recession in March 1991 . It is not clear in which direction the Fed would move if it changed xshort term rates . Private economists think it would raise rates to slow economic growth and reassure the bond markets that inflation was under control . But such an increase would make stocks x with their fixed dividends x even (less) not attractive to investors than money market funds x possibly driving the stock market down further . Lowering xshort term rates would make stocks more appealing but risk further harm to bond markets . Susan M .

While investors may be hurt by the recent downturn x she said x the stock market remains high enough to fulfill its basic economic function of providing financing for companies . On Thursday she said that when the stock market is (no) (no longer) not capable of providing a source of financing x that seems to be more of a consideration in setting monetary policy . Fed Funds Rate Raised  The Fed raised the interest rate for overnight loans between banks x the Fed funds rate x on Feb 4 and again on March 22 . The two increases x each a quarter percentage point x have pushed this rate up to 3dot5 percent . Long term interest rates rose after the first rate increase but dropped temporarily after the second .

Fed officials are acutely aware that any move to raise or lower the Fed funds rate x which the Fed controls x would have unpredictable effects on stock and bond markets x which the Fed does not control . Long term rates have risen 1 .11 percentage points since Feb 4 x surprising Fed officials x who view the increase as unjustified . Given what I would regard as a realistic outlook for inflation x I was surprised they have run up as far as they have x Mr Kelley said . Effect on Economy Feared  Administration officials fear that a further rise in long term rates could slow economic growth . Mr Kelley played down the announcement last Friday of a sharp increase in nonfarm jobs during March x saying it was more appropriate to look at the average rate of monthly job creation for the entire first quarter . The average rate was 200 ,000 jobs a month x as opposed to the 456 ,000 in March cited by the Labor Department x and Mr Kelley said such a level did not by itself signal inflation ahead . I think it's more useful to focus on a rate of 200 ,000 a month x and I think there's (nothing) not inherently inflationary for some period of time about that x he said . But Mr Kelley said he remained concerned that the economy was growing at a pace that would eventually feed inflation . As one looks a year out x one has to see a potential for renewed inflationary pressures as we approach full utilization of the economy x he said .

With a $2dot2 billion projected budget gap to close xhoped that an improving economy might let them make up for the wage freezes and benefits reductions forced on them during hard times . They are finding x however x that tax cuts x not wage increases x are the order of the day . A few years ago x administrations pointed to fall xwell with recession weary taxpayers . The recession has made it politically acceptable to go after public employees x complained Robert Yackel x head of the AFL . CIO .'s state and local workers' federation in New Jersey . You still have high unemployment out there x people are having to take second jobs to make ends meet x and they see public employees with steady jobs and steady incomes and they get resentful . Some experts on state fiscal issues say that state payrolls x particularly fringe benefits x deserve to be re examined in light of new fiscal realities . Sharp Contrast With 1980's  I think everything ought to be on the table in states that are in serious fiscal situations x particularly in a state like New Jersey x that does have high personnel spending x said Steven D . Gold x head of the Center for Study of the States at the Rockefeller Institute in Albany . The change is in sharp contrast to the relative security that public workers enjoyed as a group during the 1980's x when government employee wages at the state and local levels x while still lower than for corresponding jobs in private industry x were increasing at twice the private rate x and when a state job was considered an ironclad guarantee of lifetime job security . Over the last three years x however x New York x New Jersey and Connecticut each laid off thousands of state employees x and public workers' pay is now rising nationally at a third the rate of private employees . Most New York and New Jersey state employees have a year to go on their contracts x but labor contracts did not stop either state from saving millions of dollars since 1991 by delaying scheduled pay increases or reducing pension plan contributions . Weicker Wants Wage Freeze  In Connecticut most labor contracts expire in June x and Gov . Lowell P . Weicker Jr . has already signaled that he wants a wage freeze to help the state compensate local governments for eliminating personal property taxes .

To make good on her campaign promise to cut income taxes by 30 percent over three years x Governor Whitman must cut an additional $1dot1 billion in state spending x and there are few places other than the state's work force where she can save .

Mrs Whitman x who criticized one xshot to resort to some in her first budget . Local Cuts a Last Resort  About two thirds of the state's budget x or $10 billion x goes for public health and welfare costs or is returned to municipalities and school districts . Mrs Whitman has assured the mayors and school boards that she will cut state aid to schools and localities only as a last resort . That leaves the $4dot6 billion spent annually for state operations x of which about $2 billion pays salaries and $1dot1 billion goes for fringe benefits x including $675 million annually for pensions alone .

"179",58954,"Prices of Treasury securities decline to xrelative stability in world bond markets . On Wednesday x a plunge in world bond markets set off selling of American Treasury securities . Weakness in yesterday's session was traced to those bond investors still concerned with inflation ahead of today's scheduled employment report for February . Also weighing on the market was fear of a potential trade confrontation between the United States and Japan x which some analysts termed overblown . But other analysts say the threat is just as real for a market where nerves have frayed more each day over the last month .  In late trading x the price of a 30 year Treasury bond was down 24/32 to trade at 9222/32 as the yield x which moves in the opposite direction x rose to 6 .83 percent x from 6 .76 percent on Wednesday .

"181",59117,"Despite mounting evidence of some economic slowing x the Federal Reserve decided today against lowering interest rates x which would have made borrowing (less) not costly at the start of the holiday shopping season . Analysts generally attributed the decision to the Federal Government's stalemated budget negotiations and to the absence of compelling evidence that the economy needs to be spurred x though it is (less) not robust than during the summer .  It look xlike they are waiting until some of the uncertainty over fiscal policy and the economy is cleared up x said James F . O'Sullivan x an economist at J . P . Morgan . It's debatable whether the economy needs any stimulus . Others disagreed x pointing to weak retail sales and heavy levels of consumer debt x and to fresh figures released today that showed flat industrial production and subdued inflation in October . Consumer prices were up three tenths of 1 percent in the month x a bit more than expected x but not enough to bother economists . The central bank has cut xshort term interest rates only once this year x by one quarter of a percentage point in early July x after a 12 month pre emptive strike against inflation in which it had doubled the Federal funds rate x the benchmark overnight lending rate for the banking system x to 6 percent . The Fed signaled its decision today with its customary terse statement: The Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended at 1:30 x and there will be (no) not announcement . Representative Pete Stark of California x the ranking Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee of Congress x expressed dismay at the result x which left the Federal funds rate at what he regarded as an overly restrictive 5 3/4 percent . The negative indicators are starting to pile up x he said . The Fed should have taken action today . One possibility is that the Open Market Committee has decided to lean toward an easing of monetary policy x (without) not cutting interest rates . That would give Alan Greenspan x the Fed chairman x discretion to make a cut before the next scheduled meeting x on Dec 19 x should he think conditions warrant it . Most analysts expect the Fed to cut rates at that meeting x assuming that there is some progress toward reducing the Federal budget deficit x and that there is not sudden burst of economic vigor . A surge of growth seems unlikely x even though the fourth quarters of 1992 x 1993 and 1994 all turned out to be the strongest of the year by a wide margin . This year the quarter has gotten off to a weak start . The latest evidence was the Fed's report today that production at the nation's factories x mines and utilities fell three tenths of 1 percent in October . That was the first decline to xa small gain . The severity of the October decline to xthe fact that inventories were not drawn down in the third quarter . Consequently x industrialists are adopting a cautious posture x keeping production lean until the existing stocks are sold off . He said the possibility of slack consumer demand in the coming weeks was an additional disincentive to stepped up output . A decline to xan annual rate of 11 .6 million from 12 million x was the biggest factor in the weakened output of consumer goods . The Fed's report also showed that the utilization rate x which represents the percentage of capacity at which industry is operating x fell to 83 .6 percent last month from 84 .1 percent in September . That matched the July pace as the lowest of the year and was nearly two points below the cyclical peak posted in December 1994 and January 1995 . The operating rate is closely watched as a sign of possible future inflation . While inflationary pressure ebbed in industry x at the consumer level x prices edged up last month . The Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index climbed three tenths of 1 percent on an overall basis as xwell as with the erratic food and energy components excluded . While the increase was a bit bigger than expected x analysts found (little) not fret about x noting that some of the chief contributors x airline fares x apparel and meat x could be expected to reverse course in November . We do not believe this signals significantly higher inflation x Laurence H . Meyer and Associates x a St Louis consultancy x told clients . Energy prices rose four tenths of 1 percent x after three months of decline to xcontinue . Prices of medical xcare rose three tenths of 1 percent x the same rate as in September x with professional services showing (less) not rapid gains and medical commodities rising more rapidly . In the New York area x consumer prices moved up two tenths of 1 percent in October and 2dot6 percent over the last 12 months x compared with 2dot8 percent for the nation as a whole .

"187",59707,"Orders for durable goods surged in July x jumping 1dot6 percent . That was considerably more than analysts had expected and cast new doubt on assumptions that the economy was slowing from its unsustainable fast pace of the spring . The broadly based advance x which would have been more than twice as large had it not for a plunge in orders from the Pentagon x drove bond prices lower x raising interest rates . Traders feared the report would make the Federal Reserve more likely to tighten monetary policy . The stock market also fell .  Indeed x after the close of trading on the East Coast x the central bank disclosed that at its policy meeting in early July it had shifted to a bias toward tightening x with one member favoring an immediate increase in xshort term interest rates . The most likely outcome was a slowing of the expansion to a more sustainable pace and a continuation of subdued inflation x the central bank's minutes showed x summarizing majority opinion of the 12 voting members of its Open Market Committee . Nevertheless x the summary added x they were concerned that the risks to that outcome were tilted toward higher inflation . In the seven weeks since that meeting x evidence has mounted that the economy is throttling back as desired x and the Fed held off raising rates when it met last Tuesday . But the strong orders for long lived goods like cars and machinery reported by the Commerce Department today caused some analysts to rethink their positions . The durable goods report certainly increases the likelihood that the data in early August sent the wrong signal about growth slowing x said James F . O'Sullivan x an economist at J . P . Morgan . Nancy Lazar of the ISI . Group x a New York securities firm x said she was sticking to her view that the Fed would find it unnecessary to raise rates this year x despite what she said had become a (less) not convincing argument that the economy was slowing sufficiently on its own . One data point doesn't make a trend x Ms Lazar said of today's report . But it's not slowing very xquick to produce . And since purchases of these goods can often be easily deferred x swings in orders tend to be pronounced and to show up xquick to last at least three years . Another sign of vigor last month was a solid 3dot6 percent climb by nonmilitary capital goods other than aircraft x a gauge of the business sector's own expansion plans x following a 2dot5 percent increase in June . This was in sharp contrast to decline to xthe July data than had been supposed x she said . The Federal Reserve's minutes described an overriding concern that inflation must be kept low enough to safeguard economic expansion . But the dominant view at the sessions on July 2 and July 3 was that any tendency for price pressures to mount was likely to emerge only gradually and be reversible through a relatively limited adjustment in policy . Another reason for not raising rates then was that members feared it could have a more pronounced effect than usual x because a policy reversal might generate expectations of further tightening .

The nation's unemployment rate eased to 5dot4 percent in April x an improvement from 5dot6 percent in March and the lowest level in 14 months x despite a meager growth in payrolls of only 2 ,000 jobs .  The bond market was initially pleased with the job data x which were accompanied by a Commerce Department report of moderate increases in incomes and spending . But bond prices subsequently skidded x pushing up interest rates x after investors found several things to worry about x including possible hints that wage pressures were beginning to mount . [Page 33 .] Stock prices gave up early gains x and blue chips sank in late trading . Unlike the two preceding months x when job growth far exceeded expectations and frightened inflation wary securities markets x the April results reduced chances that the Federal Reserve would find it necessary to tighten monetary policy soon . Fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates x perhaps as early as this month x mounted on Thursday x when the Government reported that the economy grew at a 2dot8 percent pace in the first three months of the year x about double most predictions . The Clinton Administration x xquick look at several months running x added Mr Boehne x who serves on the policy making Open Market Committee x we have a growth in employment of 166 ,000 on average per month x which is a number that's quite consistent with this moderate growth path . The Labor Department's survey of households found the labor force shrank 294 ,000 in April x enough to push the unemployment rate down to the bottom end of the range of 5dot4 to 5dot8 percent within which it has fluctuated since October 1994 . The number of newly unemployed x those idled for (less) not five weeks x fell for the second consecutive month x consistent with other figures showing a decline to xcombine the April results with those of preceding months in concluding that the economy was showing solid but not runaway growth . The job data from February and March overstated economic strength x Edward S . Hyman and Nancy Lazar of the International Strategy and Investment Group told clients . The April employment report probably overstates economic weakness . For workers x the signs of higher hourly pay were welcome x but analysts said the markets seemed to focus their fears that inflation might heat up on the calculation that average hourly earnings jumped last month by 7 cents x to $11 .75 x after a 2 cent March rise . Katharine G . Abraham x the Commissioner of Labor Statistics x noted that the 12 month increase in hourly earnings was now 3dot1 percent x close to what prevailed over the last year but somewhat higher than the experience from 1992 through early 1995 . But others dismissed the latest jump as another example of how hourly earnings tend to surge in the first month of each quarter before settling back . Geographically x the department reported that the jobless rate in the Northeast x which jumped six tenths of a point in March x retreated five tenths of a point in April to stand at 5dot8 percent . Changes in the South x Midwest and West were limited in each case to a statistically insignificant one tenth of a point . Consumer spending rose six tenths of 1 percent in March x just half the February pace x the Commerce Department said . Spending spurted in February after severe weather had curbed consumption . The department also reported that personal incomes rose five tenths of 1 percent in March x slower than the eight tenths of 1 percent advance a month earlier .

After more than a decade of contracts that provided annual raises of at least 8 percent x most teachers' unions have been accepting increases of 5 percent or (less) not since 1993 . Frank Belluscio x a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association x said the downward trend started in 1991 x when the recession was at its peak . Since then x Governor Whitman's tax cuts and a growing dissatisfaction with public schools have increased pressure for unions to accept more modest contracts x he said .  Communities have been telling boards of education that they want a firmer hand at the negotiating table x Mr Belluscio said . We are seeing settlement rates come further down every quarter of every year . For 166 school districts whose teacher contracts expired in 1995 x the average salary increase for 1995 96 was 4 .52 percent x according to the School Boards Association . That amounts to about $2 ,050 x based on an average teacher's salary of $45 ,350 . For three year contracts x the total wage increase has ranged from 9 percent in Riverside x a small Burlington County district x to 17 .3 percent in Sayreville x a large Middlesex County district .

Klagholz x is intended to meet a court order requiring that students around the state receive a thorough and efficient education x regardless of how much money their district can spend . At a conference last weekend x members of the School Boards Assocation suggested that school districts should become even more prudent with salaries and benefits x which take up about 75 percent of the roughly $11 .5 billion the state and local districts spend each year on education . In particular x the association is recommending changes to the lifetime tenure system that was started in 1909 to discourage patronage hiring . Instead of granting all teachers automatic tenure after three years on the job x the association wants a system of renewable contract employment x in which teachers would be re evaluated every three to five years and districts would have the option of dismissing them . Mr Belluscio says the time is ripe for tenure reform because a disproportionate number of teachers are preparing to retire x and they will be replaced by young teachers starting from scratch . But Mr Gallagher said the New Jersey Education Association would fight changes to the tenure system x because teachers already receive yearly evaluations and job protection is more important than ever if the Legislature approves the new financing plan . The Commissioner has not defined what he means by efficiencies x Mr Gallagher said .

A wide variety of recent economic measurements have shown that inflation remains at barely xnoticeable levels x below an annual rate of 2 percent in the first half of the year .

"199",60250,"With the war barely xover x Life magazine laid out x in a 1946 photo essay x a roseate and wondrous American dream . A single story stone and clapboard home appeared in the centerfold photo . And spread over the front lawn were the gadgets of the envisioned prosperity: a convertible x a three burner electric stove x a small television screen embedded in a bulky wooden cabinet x a children's slide x flimsy aluminum lawn chairs x a plastic garden hose x a gasoline lawn mower . In hindsight x Life's vision was surprisingly modest . The next quarter century turned out to be a golden age x and as living standards rose x the furnishings of Life's American dream became commonplace x even in the homes of many working poor .  Then came 1973 x one of the great turning points of the post World War II era . It was the year in which the dollar came off the gold standard . the oil embargo struck . worldwide grain shortages developed . The widespread rise in prosperity came to a halt . Inflation x stagnant wages x shrinking unions x growing income inequality x spreading poverty and outdated factories all left scars . An economy that had been so plentiful for so many for so long suddenly followed a different path x leaving big portions of the population behind . Now the United States appears to be at another turning point . Some of the hallmarks of the 1946 73 era are reappearing . Perhaps 1997 will turn out to be as much a landmark in American economic history as 1973 . But the new age x if it materializes x is not likely to re create the postwar xsense of bounty . Instead x people are carrying into the future the residue of the stagnant years x and their compromised expectations . Rather than counting on rising prosperity x Americans are betting that by working ever harder x they may manage to cling to leadership in the world economy . We are not xsense back x said Robert M . Solow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology x a Nobel laureate in economics . There may be some economic measures that are equal to or even better than the pre 1973 years . But not level of wellxbeing . Three statistics from the old days have reappeared: a low inflation rate x an unemployment rate of (less) not 5 percent and a return of corporate profits x as a xshare of the overall economy x close to the hefty levels of the 1960's . Not since the pre 1973 era have such hallmarks of a vibrant economy coexisted so persistently . Naturally enough x these parallels with the golden era are generating considerable optimism . At McKinsey and Company x the consulting firm x William Lewis x director of its Global Institute x declares that America's competitive laissez faire economy should be the model for all nations . Wired x the monthly bible of the digerati x proclaims that the global economy x led by the United States x is entering a long boom x driven by powerful new technologies and the spread of capitalism to nearly every region of the world . And Fortune magazine x in a long article this month x states flatly of America: These are the good old days . But for most Americans x it is not like the good old days . Holding onto a job now takes precedence over upward mobility x or getting decent annual raises . Just prolonging an expansion has become more important than generating the robust economic growth that made the pre 1973 period golden . Corporate success in global competition has become an overriding goal x even at the price of greater wage inequality or leaving some groups behind . Longer hours on the job have displaced the pre 1973 goal of more leisure time to use the lawn furniture in Life's family utopia . And job insecurity x cowed labor x in the phrasing of the economist Paul Samuelson x has become an accepted means of prolonging the economic cycle x mainly by suppressing wage increases and inflation . Before 1973 x said Richard T . Curtin x director of the University of Michigan's consumer confidence surveys x there was this deep belief in personal financial progress . In that xsense x it is very different today . We don't expect a recession . But we (no) (no longer) not result x the nation's policy makers x along with many economists x did an about face in their view of the economy's productive capacity . The national output x once viewed as boundless x now seemed quite constrained . Until 1973 x the big economic issue had been how to generate enough demand to keep the economy growing strongly . The standard measures included tax cuts x public works projects x jobs programs x a higher minimum wage . Supply was taken for granted . The prevailing view was that companies could always jack up production (without) not xstrain of goods and services . When belief shifted x reality didxtoo x said David Collander x an economic historian at Middlebury College . Capacity is three things . It is enough workers to make or provide all that Americans seek to buy . It is enough factories x offices x warehouses and stores x and enough machinery x computers and other equipment to produce all the goods and services that Americans want . Finally x there is productivity x or the amount that workers x using the buildings and equipment x can produce in a given time period . If productivity does not grow fast enough x supply can not either . Demand can outstrip supply . From 1946 to 1973 x productivity rose x on average x nearly 3 percent a year . But after 1973 x the annual advances averaged only 1 percent x xwell below the long term trend of more than 2 percent a year in the century after the Civil War . So x starting in 1973 x the nation's policy makers increasingly dealt with the perceived ceiling on supply by restricting demand . The restraint came from the Federal Reserve x whose principal tool for regulating the economy was interest rates . If unemployment got too xlow x that meant not enough labor capacity x and the Fed x rather than risk wage pressures and shortages x raised interest rates to discourage spending and reduce demand . By the end of the 1970's x with inflation and unemployment rising in tandem x the Fed chose to fight inflation with higher rates x xpay attention to unemployment . In this atmosphere x labor's bargaining power came unglued . Corporate profits weakened along with demand . The nation's capital stock per worker x the machinery and equipment available for each worker to get the job done x has grown more slowly in each decade since 1973 x despite huge investments in computers . And x starting in 1973 x the United States entered what is arguably its longest period of slow economic growth since the Civil War . The official statistics say that economic growth is still modest . But the simultaneous arrival of low inflation x low unemployment and strong profits has some economists x and many corporate executives x convinced that the official statistics must be wrong . Solve the mismeasurement x they say x and the nation's economic growth rate in recent years x supported by rising productivity x will come out look xlike those postwar years . But a closer look shows that the differences outweigh the similarities . THEN x In the golden age of 1946 73 x the United States was relatively insulated from the global economy and produced most of what Americans consumed . NOW x Many more consumer goods are produced abroad x helping to restrain inflation but applying pressure to hold down wages . THEN x From the late 1940's to the early 1970's x incomes rose sharply x allowing many families with only one earner to afford the American dream . NOW x It generally takes at least two earners to achieve a middle class living standard . THEN x In the first decades after World War II x productivity gains were strong x providing greater leisure time . NOW Not only are more people working x but 10 hour workdays are common x cutting into family life . Photo . (Bernard Hoffman x Life Magazine x Time Inc .)

"202",60565,"The yen's sudden jump against the dollar this past week threatens to take the momentum out of Japan's exports by making it more costly for America and other foreign markets to buy Japanese products . If the yen's new found strength lasts x economists say x it could even prolong Japan's worst postwar recession .  Big corporate exporters such as the Sony Corporation x the Honda Motor Company x the Fuji Photo Film Company and the NEC Corporation have been caught off guard by the yen's abrupt about face . The yen's higher exchange value makes their products more expensive abroad and lowers the value of their foreign earnings when converted back into yen . If the high yen trend continues x we will see the influence on our sales and profits within several months x Tamotsu Iba x xvice president of Sony x said in a statement . The current rapid rise in the yen does not reflect the fundamentals of the Japanese economy . Up until this week x the yen had been weakening for months x a reflection of the litany of economic problems confronting Japan: debt laden banks x rising bankruptcies x fall xwell .

But I still think that x net net x it's hard to say it's positive for the exporters . Some companies did offer rudimentary snapshots of the potential impact of the yen's swing .

Thus x the recent seesaw of the rate from 135 .35 yen to the dollar when trading opened this week to 116 .95 yen in late New York trading today caused a slide of more than $780 million in potential earnings from Sony's operating profits .

The yen's rise is not necessarily viewed as a bad development elsewhere in Asia x in fact x other weakened Asian economies could benefit from a rising yen because it would make their exports more competitive . Stock markets in Hong Kong x Singapore x South Korea and Thailand rose today because of that prospect .

But amid these negative signs x American corporations were pouring billions into new technology x consumers were buying cars and other expensive products x and exporters x who had been struggling all year as markets in Asia and Latin America headed south x saw their overseas sales snap back . To be sure x some of the fourth quarter's strength reflected one time events x the General Motors Corporation catching up after its strike x the Boeing Company making aircraft deliveries x construction crews taking advantage of unseasonably warm weather x and most economists expect the latest figures to be trimmed a bit when more data become available and the GDP . report is revised next month . But with sales soaring x inventories lean and (no) not inflation x there seemed (little) not question that the economy barreled into the new year with terrific momentum . I don't see anything that could trigger recession in 1999 x said William Dunkelberg x chief economist at the National Federation for Independent Business x who noted that business spending and hiring plans remained strong . Christopher Low x the chief economist at First Tennessee Capital Markets x said x Typically x when we have inventories weaker than expected and demand stronger than expected x that portends stronger growth down the road . As usual x consumers accounted for most of the growth last year . Consumer spending rose at a strong 4dot4 percent in the fourth quarter and 4dot8 percent for the year x even though unseasonably warm temperatures meant lower heating bills . Purchases of cars and big ticket items for homes soared at a 21 percent annual rate . Earlier this month x GM x the Ford Motor Company and other car makers reported that December sales were running at an annual rate of more than 17 million cars and trucks a month x up 7 percent from a year earlier . New home construction rose at a 10 percent annual rate . Consumers and home buyers have not spent this freely since right after the 1981 82 recession . There's (no) not Michigan reported yesterday that its consumer confidence index x based on surveys of consumers x rose to a lofty 103 .9 at the end of January from 100 .5 in December . The index reflects consumers' positive assessment of current economic conditions and their optimism about the future . Less expected was the big bounceback in business spending for new equipment x especially computers and other high technology products . Capital goods spending x which had leveled out last summer x soared at a 21 percent annual rate as businesses x facing the tightest labor market in a generation x scrambled to improve efficiency and keep costs under control . Meanwhile x businesses increased their stocks at a slower rate than in the third quarter as they struggled to keep up with sales x a favorable development that suggests they will not cutting production in the months ahead . The drag from America's $263 billion trade deficit proved (less) not potent than one might expect . While imports xshot to x1 percent . another big run up x more than 25 percent x in the stock market x and the Federal Reserve's willingness to reduce interest rates last xfall in response to global financial turmoil when the domestic economy was showing few signs of slowing . All three factors bolstered incomes and spending power . We were getting this injection of adrenalin x said Robert Gordon x an economist at Northwestern University . Investors agreed x sending stock and bond prices higher yesterday .

The trade gap reached $34 .3 billion in September as imports rose to $126 .62 billion x up 3dot1 percent from August x and exports fell 0dot7 percent x to $92 .36 billion x the Commerce Department announced today . The deficit is on course to reach $365 billion this year x it grows on average by $1 billion a day x with the total likely to surpass the record 1999 level by about $100 billion .  Most economists have treated the seemingly relentless march of the deficit with relative equanimity this year x arguing that it reflects the disproportionate strength of the United States economy compare xagainst most major currencies all year raises the risk of a hard landing . This is the Damocles' sword hanging over us x the largest long term threat to our economy x said Greg Mastel x a trade expert at the New America Foundation . The next administration is likely to have to adjust trade policy x dollar policy and fiscal policy to find a solution . The deficit numbers prompted several Wall Street analysts to lower their estimates for economic growth for the third quarter . Several said that they feared that the weak exports reflected tough competition from abroad while high imports suggested that retailers were piling up goods for Christmas sales that some think may be (less) not vigorous than expected x leaving bloated inventories . Salomon Smith Barney downgraded estimates of economic growth in the third quarter to slightly (less) not 2 percent x from 2dot7 percent x arguing that the poor trade performance knocked anywhere from half to three quarters of a percentage point off domestic growth for the quarter .

But that view assumes that the deficit will top out on its own and not expand quickly . The combination of expensive oil x the recent surge in the value of the dollar against the euro and tough competition for American manufacturers has actually prompted the deficit to widen faster than it did earlier this year .

"222",62087,"Argentine bond and stock prices fell sharply yesterday after the country's economy minister indicated that he wanted to voluntarily restructure Argentina's billions of dollars in public sector debt x including that owned by foreigners .  Such a move acknowledged how much more serious the country's financial crisis is . The economic slowdown around the world after the terrorist attack on America is just deepening a recession in Argentina that already is more than three years old . And there are fewer and fewer spending cuts the country can make so that it can meet its interest and principal payments .  But some analysts argue that the effort to restructure the debt x although necessary to reduce the country's debt burden x could lead to a default . Some major credit agencies have said that even a voluntary restructuring of Argentina's debt would lead them to give the debt a default rating . But it is not clear if a voluntary restructuring would qualify as a legal default . Some analysts argue that it would not . The news sent Argentine bonds prices down as much as 14 percent while yields on one benchmark bond soared to 45 percent . The yield on an index of Argentine bonds jumped to almost 20 percent points over comparable United States Treasury securities . The local stock market index x the Merval x plunged 8 .76 percent . Delays in new economic policy announcements from the government also made investors nervous yesterday x as did the resignation of Argentina's undersecretary of finance . Some analysts interpreted his resignation as a sign of disagreement within the government over how to resolve the country's debt problems .

Mr Cavallo said that he wanted an integral solution to the country's debt problem as soon as possible x according to a translation by BNP Paribas . But he emphasized that he wanted such restructuring to be voluntary x adding that he did not like the word restructure because it seemed to imply coercion . The newspaper also said that Mr Cavallo had been working with Jacob Frenkel x a former top official of the International Monetary Fund and a former governor of the Bank of Israel . Mr Frenkel is now the president of Merrill Lynch International . A Merrill spokesman said (nothing) not formalized with Argentina but confirmed there had been discussions about hiring Mr Frenkel and Merrill . Argentina has about $132 billion in public sector debt x of which about $70 billion is in global bonds . Mr Cavallo indicated that he wanted to swap this old x high interest rate debt for new securities that have a lower interest rate . He did not say how he would entice investors into such a swap x but indicated that Argentina would be better able to guarantee that the principle and interest would be paid . Several analysts said that such a big swap x or restructuring x of debt would be hard to accomplish voluntarily . If it provided any major relief for Argentina from its burden of interest and principle payments it might turn out to be a very unattractive swap for investors . If you do an exercise that massive on favorable terms x the chances that you will be successful with a voluntary restructuring is not high x said Jose M . Barrionuevo x director of emerging markets strategy and economics at BNP Paribas . Mr Cavallo had been working on a swap of old debt for new x lower interest debt with local banks and pension funds and apparently still wants to include this debt in any swap . But some top credit rating agencies said that they would view such a swap as a default x even if voluntary . In a statement on Oct 16 x Standard and Poor's said it regarded the completions of a debt exchange as tantamount to a default x if the total value of the securities or cash offered is materially (less) not originally contracted amount (even though it may be greater than the current depressed market value of the debt) .

"224",62136,"THERE is almost (no) not end to the uncertainty about the economy . Here are three questions whose answers could go a long way toward clarifying the outlook .  Can the productivity miracle continue .  The foundation of the prosperity that the United States enjoyed in the 1990's was the resurgence in the nation's ability to produce more for (less) not . After languishing for decades x the growth rate of productivity x or output per hour worked x took off in the middle of the last decade x creating conditions under which both workers and companies could earn more (without) not generating inflation . The improvement was driven largely by advances in technology . But it also reflected a pervasive economic and cultural push x prompted by intense international competition and pressure from Wall Street for consistent earnings improvement x to make companies and the economy more efficient . Technology is likely to remain a powerfully positive economic force . Although companies have cut back substantially on capital spending x they are only beginning to reap the benefits of advances in automation x communications and data analysis . But the flexible x cost squeezing nature of the economy is giving way to something more hardened and expensive . Companies in many industries are facing higher insurance costs and are devoting large amounts of money to security and backing up computer operations . Banks are likely to face increased costs as the government cracks down on money laundering and closely monitors international money flows . Moving goods and people around has become more time consuming and expensive . The border with Canada x for example x has gone from being all but invisible to being a bottleneck for automobiles and parts going back and forth between the two countries . The New York Washington shuttle flights started again last week x but the days of showing up at the airport at the last minute and hopping aboard are over . None of these things by themselves are enough to alter the course of an economy as big and resilient as this one . Still x the cumulative effect could be a gradual erosion in productivity improvements . If the erosion is permanent x many of the assumptions about the vibrancy and potential of the new economy will be called into question . If it is temporary x the long term outlook will remain bright . What will happen to long term interest rates . The sagging stock market has eaten into the wealth of many households . But for most people x the prime repository of net xworth is their home . So far x housing prices have held up fairly well . More important x low and decline to xrefinance their mortgages . In the process x many people have reduced their monthly payments x freeing cash to spend on other things . Some people have chosen to use equity from their homes in lump sums to buy a car x take a vacation or put aside for a rainy day . Alan Greenspan x the Federal Reserve chairman x often points out that the stimulative effect on the housing market of low interest rates has been important in keeping the economy from weakening even more than it has . And as he has counseled Congress about an economic recovery package of tax cuts and new spending x Mr Greenspan has warned against busting the budget to the degree that investors will be alarmed and long term interest rates will climb . There is already some sign of upward pressure on long term rates x even though the Fed has cut xshort term rates aggressively . If rates begin rising for mortgages x as xwell as corporate bonds and other types of longer term borrowing x the prospects for a rapid recovery would dim . Will Japan and Europe stabilize their economies . There is (no) not realistic prospect that the United States will get any economic help from abroad during this business cycle . But it is still not clear whether deteriorating economic conditions in Japan and Europe will prove to be merely unhelpful or actively harmful . The new European Central Bank has been slow to cut interest rates this year despite the weakening of national economies across the Continent . Its focus appears to have been more on building its credibility in fighting inflation than on trying to encourage an economic turnaround . Should it remain stingy with rate reductions x the weakness in Europe could linger for some time . The Bank of Japan has been ineffectual for years in ending Japan's decadelong slump . There are signs that it may finally be learning its lesson . But the banking system in Japan is extremely rickety x and a financial meltdown there would have global repercussions .

"225",62149,"The number of workers filing new claims for state unemployment benefits soared last week to a nine year high as economic damage spread from the terrorist attacks .  Initial jobless claims rose by 71 ,000 x to 528 ,000 x in the week ended Saturday x the Labor Department said . The level of new claims is the most since the week ended July 25 x 1992 x during a companywide shutdown of plants by General Motors .  The rise comes after a gain of 64 ,000 the previous week and reflects job cuts at airlines and travel related companies . The attacks disrupted business across the nation and probably pushed the economy into recession x analysts say . This is just the initial wave of layoffs due to the attacks x said Steven Wood x chief economist at FinancialOxygen Inc . There's another wave behind it . Announcements of job cuts rose to a record 248 ,332 in September x according to the outplacement firm Challenger x Gray and Christmas . That was the most since 205 ,975 job cuts were announced in July and more than four times the number in September last year . Increasing job cuts help explain why the unemployment rate probably rose to a four year high of 5 percent in September x according to the median forecast in a separate Bloomberg News survey . Employers are likely to have eliminated 100 ,000 jobs last month after a reduction of 113 ,000 in August x according to the survey . That would be the first time since March April 1991 x the end of the last recession x that payrolls were cut by 100 ,000 or more workers in consecutive months . The Labor Department is scheduled to release those statistics on Friday . Because federal law requires companies under certain conditions to give workers 60 days' notice of mass dismissals x the latest surge in announced layoffs may not show up on the unemployment rolls for several more weeks . The four week moving average of claims x which smooths out volatility in the weekly numbers x rose last week to 453 ,500 x the highest since December 1991 as unemployment continued to rise in the wake of the last recession x from 424 ,000 the previous week . We are beginning to see secondary impact across the country from the terrorist attacks x said Cynthia Ambler x a Labor Department spokeswoman . The department expects to have more detail next week when state reports are more complete x she said . A separate government report showed new orders placed at manufacturers were (little) not changed in August as inventories decline to xa report from the National Association of Purchasing Management that was released earlier this week . Nonetheless x the group's measure of new orders showed that more manufacturers reported increasing orders in August and September than posted a decline .

In addition x initial claims for unemployment benefits reached their highest level last week in five years x the Labor Department said yesterday .

"234",62565,"During the first three months of the year x many investors wondered just how much worse things could get in the stock market .

A key reason for the buying power is a still strong employment market . According to the Labor Department x 135 ,000 jobs were added in February . But consumer spending could dry up if a recent increase in layoffs begins to multiply . Delphi Automotive Systems x Charles Schwab x Citigroup x Motorola and Procter and Gamble have announced recently that they are cutting their work forces .

Miller x portfolio manager at Trevor x Stewart Burton and Jacobsen x a money management firm in New York . Managements are going to respond the same way they have in every other recession x through general contraction . The problem is that consumers have (little) not cushion to soften the blow of layoffs . Many of their personal balance sheets are creaking under a load of debt x and savings are close to nonexistent . During the 90's x Americans piled on debt . Consumer debt as a xshare of the xgross domestic product now stands at close to 71 percent x a new high x and up almost half from the early 1980's . As a xshare of personal income x household debt has risen to 85 percent x also a record . According to Moody's Investors Service x American households' liquid financial assets x including savings accounts and other assets that can be converted to cash relatively easily x dropped 13 .2 percent in the first three months of this year from the first three months of 2000 . Although these household assets as a percentage of debt are still greater than they were from 1985 to 1990 x this quarter's plunge would be the steepest since a 14 .3 percent decline to xa negative 0 .98 percent x the lowest ever . In February it rose a bit x but it remains at a negative 0 .91 percent . Indebtedness to income levels are as high as they have ever been x Mr Paulsen of Wells Capital said . You can be very indebted x but it will (never) not surface if everyone has a job . If we have a large rise in unemployment x we may find out how bad the debt problem is among the lower half of the income distribution . And that has a lot of ripples . Mr Paulsen says that the recent weakness in the prices of consumer stocks may be forecasting a decline to xsee some of these consumer statistics really tail off . Economists at Goldman x Sachs estimate that from 1995 to 2000 x the rise in household net xworth x largely owing to the stock market's surge x propelled growth in the xgross domestic product by more than one percentage point a year . At the same time x the xsavings rate fell . Now that stock investors have lose the xmix . The market's very troubled by the fact that earnings aren't recovering x Mr McKelvey said . Add to that a nervousness about the consumer and a general recognition that the slowdown we are in has a xsignificant risk of turning into a recession .

"235",62633,"Herbert V . Kohler Jr . x chairman of the Kohler Company x was caught by surprise when the economic slowdown hit last xfall . In the past x sales of the company's bathroom and kitchen fixtures invariably began to fall six months before the economy did x giving him plenty of warning . They are my leading indicator x Mr Kohler said . But this time x toilets x sinks and bathtubs kept on selling as briskly as ever x and they still are .  No sector x despite Kohler's experience x is feel xlike Kohler x have (hardly) not touched . Others x like the Fluor Corporation x a giant engineering and construction operation x are hurting in America and thriving overseas . Still others x like the Goodman Equipment Corporation x a maker of small locomotives for mining and tunnel building x are shipping their main products in the old volumes x but feeling the slowdown in sales of spare parts x a secondary source of revenue . Despite these wide differences among manufacturers x their strategies for the weeks ahead are eerily uniform . Bracing for the worst x most of America's industrial leaders are hunkering down by eliminating overtime x putting a freeze on hiring x scaling back on new investment and shrinking the number of jobs at their companies . Yet in doing so to strengthen their operations for the longer term x they may be helping to make it more likely that in the xshort run a full blown recession could indeed arrive . When uncertainty spreads x as it is spreading now x you focus on defending your profitability x said Ralph F . Hake x executive xvice president and chief financial officer at Fluor . And that x unfortunately x is self defeating . Top executives from more than 100 manufacturing companies gathered in Key Largo x Fla . x last weekend for the winter board meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers and concluded that the economic slowdown would endure . In a poll x 53 percent of the 88 executives who responded predicted that economic growth would remain very weak or even nonexistent until year's end x missing the early summer revival that many forecasters still expect . Such gloomy sentiments x useful to the association in persuading the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again and again x stand in striking contrast to the more upbeat stories that many manufacturers tell about their current situation . Motorola is more the exception than the rule . With its cell phone business in free fall x it may lose your xshelf .' Still x there is a safety valve . Over the years x Goodman has outsourced almost everything except the actual locomotive assembly . Lately x the outsourcing has produced an unanticipated dividend . The suppliers have been calling on us much more aggressively x Mr Campbell said . We can give a 10 percent discount on the locomotives we sell because we can get discounts on what is coming in from our suppliers . If Goodman Equipment is getting relief from its suppliers x the huge Manitowoc Company x with headquarters in Manitowoc x Wis . x is creating its own relief . It has sped up production in response to the reluctance of its customers to be more generous in their ordering . Manitowoc's product line includes construction cranes x some of them giant contraptions mounted on crawlers that can lift a thousand tons x roughly 50 elephants x 400 feet . The $6 million price tag means that buyers finance purchases x not only of the biggest cranes but also of the smallest version x selling for $500 ,000 . They are not happy about the cost of doing that at today's interest rates x even allowing for the Federal Reserve's rate cuts starting in January x says Terry D . Growcock x chief executive at Manitowoc . So the orders are being placed at the last minute x only after a contract has been signed for a construction job instead of six months in xadvance in anticipation of the contract . We are still selling roughly 200 cranes a year x Mr Growcock said . But with much (less) not order backlog x we have to build the cranes in 50 to 60 days instead of the 120 that prevailed a couple of years ago . It forces you to work much more closely with your suppliers . Like many executives in manufacturing x Ronald P . Sandmeyer Jr . x chief executive of the family owned Sandmeyer Steel Company in Philadelphia x is braced for the worst . So when orders dropped off last month for Sandmeyer's stainless steel plate x overtime for the 150 employees quickly disappeared . The company is still getting about 100 requests a month for price quotes x but our customers are not pulling the trigger at the same rate x Mr Sandmeyer said . Instead of the usual 35 orders x the company got 29 in the last month x and for smaller amounts than usual . But February is always a weak month x and Mr Sandmeyer worries about overreacting x hunkering down too xmuch . It is too xsoon to know what is happening to us x he said x but certainly it is a concern when I hear what I am hearing . I don't know if we are talking ourselves into a recession .

Unfortunately x the hangover has not go back x said Byron Wien x the senior investment strategist at Morgan Stanley . And if they have had their bonuses cut and the person next door has been laid off x that's going to put them in a bad mood x even if they still have their jobs . Mr Wien expects the economy to grow at almost 3 percent in 2003 and stocks to rise 8 to 10 percent . We are going to have reasonable growth x a reasonable stock market x he said .

The current weakness could be (nothing) not similar transition period x as telecommunications x energy and technology companies work down the glut of excess capacity they created during the bubble . After two years of job cuts and delayed investments x businesses are running lean x said James Paulson x chief investment officer of Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis . An extra dollar of sales is going to go right to the bottom line . Profits could revive much faster than people think x at least for a while . Mr Paulson predicts that the economy will grow extremely strongly next year . Pessimists have focused too xmuch on the apparently limited effectiveness of Fed rate cuts x he said . But for most of the last two years x the economy has faced other trouble spots that have blunted the Fed's moves x including a strong dollar x which hurts exports x and high real long term interest rates . Now the dollar has weakened x and in the xfall interest rates on the 10 year Treasury note slipped below 4 percent x their lowest levels since 1962 .

He expects economic growth to top 4 percent in 2003 x and said it could reach 6 percent if business spending revives xquick to the weaker dollar . But like the pessimism of Mr Gross x the optimism of Mr Paulson stands on the far edge of the bell curve of economic opinion . In the words of Tobias M .

"244",63435,"NOTHING props up the economy more than consumers x and dips in their spending frighten forecasters . But that is all that has happened in recent years x dips x not plunges . Consumers in America spend because they feel they must spend . More than in the past x the necessities of life x real and perceived x eat up their incomes .  That treadmill spending is good news for the economy . As a recovery takes hold x the biggest threat to its survival would be a downturn in consumer spending . That is not inconceivable: The support for recent spending x the household cash generated through mortgage refinancings and tax cuts x is disappearing x and a new source of cash x from many new jobs and many new paychecks x is not reality .  But do not worry x various experts say . Consumers will keep spending anyway x going deeper into debt to do so if they must . They have too xmany needs x some that were luxuries only yesterday . A second car and child xcare x for example x are now necessities for millions of households with two earners commuting to jobs . Mall crawling x for all its popularity x is increasingly the anomaly x not norm x in the vast realm of personal consumption . So as the typical household keeps spending x and as other sectors of the economy revive x the country will prosper . There is considerable optimism on this point among the nation's forecasters . All but one of the 51 surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators expect the economy to grow more strongly in 2004 than it has in the past 33 months x expanding at a 4 percent annual rate x up from (less) not 3 percent through most of the past three years . The economic upturn does have staying power x said Lynn Reaser x chief economist of Banc America Capital Management x the primary investment management group of the Bank of America . Business investment x she notes x is already on the rise x profits are soaring and stock prices have gone up x reawakening the wealth effect . Above all x consumption outlays x which (never) not flagged during the 2001 recession and the weak economic growth thereafter x surged in the third quarter x contributing significantly to economic growth . Not surprisingly x mortgage refinancing reached a peak in this quarter x as homeowners took advantage of low interest rates x and so did the effects of the tax cuts championed by the Bush administration . Without that support x consumer spending may dip in the months ahead x but it will not plunge . Too much of a household's income goes for items now considered necessities . This spending truly matters . Consumers are purchasing roughly $7dot6 trillion a year in goods and services . Their outlays represent about two thirds of the nation's economic activity x so when people slow their buying x the growth of the economy also slows . But that seldom happens anymore . Look back to 1947 x a total of 227 quarters . In only 20 of these three month periods did a drop or weakness in consumer spending curb economic growth or weaken an expansion x and most of that occurred in the early decades . Only three times in the last two decades has consumer spending faltered enough to damage the economy x twice during the 1990 1991 recession and once as the slow recovery got under way . That drag disappeared in the 2001 recession x the first since the 1940's in which consumer spending rose enough to limit the contraction instead of contributing to it . This suggests that consumers are earmarking an increasing xshare for purchases that are x or that they consider x necessary x even in recessions . The spending you can't fool around with has gone up x for homes x health insurance x day xcare x car payments x said Elizabeth Warren x a Harvard Law School professor and co author of The Two Income Trap (Basic Books x 2003) . She argues that the optional portion of consumer spending has become relatively small . SO even if more jobs and more paychecks fail to xmaterialize x the typical household will keep up its spending x Ms Warren contends . People will do so by going into debt x or deeper into debt x to acquire what they view as essentials . Such consumption will help sustain the economy in the coming presidential election year x although painfully for many households . It is hard to construct a happy story for 2004 unless we consistently create a xsignificant number of jobs x which we have not yet x said Mark Zandi x chief economist at Economycom x a research and consulting firm . The happy story will materialize once the strengthening economy is consistently generating 300 ,000 jobs a month x said Jared Bernstein x senior labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute . So far x job creation x while finally rising x has not reached half that level . If the level is reached soon and maintained over the next year x that would be enough to absorb the nearly 3 million people who want to work and begin to push wages up . Real disposable personal income x that is after tax income x has risen by 3dot2 percent over the past year x but that resulted almost entirely from the mortgage refinancings and tax cuts x the Commerce Department reported . The wage portion has been stagnant for nearly three years . Nonlabor sources have been the sole driver of real disposable income x Mr Bernstein said . The growing list of purchases that households consider essential helps explain why personal consumption expenditures x as the Commerce Department calls them x held up so xwell over the last 33 months x which included an eight month recession followed by persistently weak economic growth . There have been 10 recessions since World War II x and this was the first in which consumer spending provided support instead of dragging the economy down . With jobs disappearing and wage income going nowhere since 2001 x that support should theoretically have given way this timextoo . But households regarded an increasing portion of their outlays as essential . What is more x they had nonwage means to pay for them . Rising home prices and fall xwell as rent x auto leases x property taxes and homeowner insurance x comes in at 18 percent of disposable income . Both measures are at near record levels x but not high as to inhibit spending x thanks mainly to low interest rates . What consumers consistentlytell us is that mortgage rates and car loan rates have (never) not lower x and that is an opportunity they don't think they should miss x said Richard T . Curtin x director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan . They don't expect these rates to be lower in their lifetimes . Now these sources of cash flow x particularly mortgage refinancing x the biggest source of all x are drying up as interest rates begin to rise in a strengthening economy x and the tax cuts run their course . As a result x the total new stimulus from these sources will be around $100 billion in 2004 x (less) not half this year's injection . Most of it will be delivered in the winter and spring in the form of tax refunds x as a result of the retroactive nature of this year's tax cut . Our models tell us that modest increases in interest rates will sharply curtail mortgage refinancing by the end of the first quarter x said Douglas Duncan x chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington . But economic rescue is at hand x the forecasters insist . They foresee rising employment that will lead to more wage income as the recovery takes root . Or x as James W . Paulsen x chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management x put it: We are switching stimulants for the household . Consumer spending is not only source of economic growth x of course . Government outlays and business investment are also big factors x but the former comes to $2dot1 trillion annually and the latter to $1dot2 trillion . So if consumer spending x the $7dot6 trillion elephant x is pulling the nation's $10 .8 trillion economy in one direction x (neither) not other factors pulling in the opposite direction is likely to win the tug of war . That is particularly the case today . Government spending is barely xrising x and business investment x although rising strongly x is limited mainly to replacement of aging computers x government data suggest . Given so much idle production capacity x economists say x business investment for expansion is not likely to kick in soon . That makes the composition of consumer spending increasingly important in assessing the economy . If consumers were to decide that they could cut back on spending x the recovery would be in trouble . However x as long as they view much of their spending as essential x it should be sufficient to support the recovery . Statistics compiled by the Commerce and Labor Departments are inconclusive on this issue because the line between discretionary and essential spending is hard to draw . They form a continuum x said Stephen Brobeck x executive director of the Consumer Federation of America x but the continuum x he said x is tilting toward more nondiscretionary spending . Typical households x those that account for more than half of the nation's personal consumption expenditures x have two earners and one or two children x according to various experts in these demographics . The two earners bring home together $60 ,000 to $80 ,000 a year x and they disperse 70 to 75 percent of it for essentials: groceries x home costs x vehicles and fuel x public transportation x education and health xcare . That outlay is up roughly four percentage points since 1990 x according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . More important is the remaining 25 percent or so of the spending . It could weaken the economy if it decline to xdefine their xquality of life as being full participants in the information age x Mr Cooper said x so they give up the connections slowly x and they feel deprived when they have to do xwithout cable TV or cellphones or the Internet . What about designer wear x electronic gadgets x television sets . They are more easily sacrificed than housing or food in hard times . Yet expenditures are rising for this merchandisextoo x strong evidence that they have been converted into essentials for many households through social pressures x says Juliet B . Schor x an economist and sociologist at Boston College and the author of The Overspent American (Basic Books x 1998) . These lifestyle and expenditure norms have risen pretty dramatically for the middle class and the upper middle class x she said . No one has been more forceful lately than Ms Warren and her daughter x Amelia Warren Tyagi x a business consultant x in pushing the message that the typical household is increasingly diverting income to purchases they now see as essential . In their book x The Two Income Trap x they define essential consumption more narrowly than Ms Schor x excluding purchases that result from social pressure . They see the pressure on a household to spend beyond its means as coming from two directions: Household incomes are rising more slowly than the costs x yet families keep up their spending because so much of it is needed to maintain a certain standard of living . Stretching to purchase a home in a community with a good school system x for example x is viewed by many as a necessity and not option x now that public school quality has decline to xbe persuaded there is (no) not hope before they do that . A third squeeze x the authors note x is that the typical household already has two adults at work . By contrast x in the early 1970's most households had one adult (usually the wife) still at home x available to take a job and supplement family income if the principal earner's wages fell short . The arguments made by Ms Warren and Ms Tyagi resonate . Personal consumption expenditures x adjusted for inflation x have risen since 1973 at a faster average annual rate than median household income x similarly adjusted for inflation: spending is up at a 3dot2 percent annual rate versus a 0dot5 percent increase in income x according to recent government data . As a result x a typical two earner household with a $68 ,000 annual income today is earmarking 75 percent of it for such fixed costs as mortgage payments x child xcare x health insurance x cars and taxes . In the early 70's x only 54 percent of a typical household's $39 ,000 income went for the same expenses x the two authors maintain . What happens when income falls short is that people start increasing the risks they take to keep up their spending x Ms Warren said . Cut off from mortgage refinancing x they turn to home equity loans x which are now on the rise x and x if they can not pay their debts x to personal bankruptcy . Bankruptcies have risen in each of the past three years . In this situation x rising employment and the new paychecks that come with it are the lifesaver nearly every forecaster is counting on to sustain consumption . But the hiring will have to be robust x approaching 300 ,000 new jobs a month x Mr McKelvey of Goldman Sachs said x echoing Mr Bernstein . Otherwise it will not generate enough new disposable income to offset the rise in debt payments as interest rates go up x and people might grow reluctant to take on new debt x even to buy essentials . That is the pessimistic scenario x Mr McKelvey said . But in my mind there will be enough job growth . that is a more realistic scenario . The numbers today have created a xsense that the process has begun to take shape x and in two or three months x we will be there .

"246",63472,"In Iowa on Monday x Howard Dean was talking not about the economy x but about the deadly turmoil in Iraq x and what it would mean for the presidential race .  It weakens the position of the president and my Democratic opponents x said Dr . Dean x a Democratic contender who x as one of the most vocal critics of the war x cited the attack on a Chinook helicopter that took the lives of 16 American soldiers on Sunday . There are now almost 400 people dead who wouldn't be dead if that resolution hadn't been passed and we hadn't gone to war .  In Birmingham x Ala . x in a speech to workers at a warehouse x President Bush talked (less) not about the latest death toll and more about the report late last week of surging third quarter economic growth . Our economy is gaining some momentum x he said x dismissing Democrats who had warned that his tax cuts would devastate the nation's economy . We have got a consistent and effective strategy x and we are making progress . The day was a snapshot of the presidential contest x as realities on the ground x the upbeat economic growth figures and the deadly helicopter attack x intruded on the best laid plans of the candidates and this White House . The Democrats want to blame Mr Bush for a weak economy that may be finding its step just in time for next year's election x while Mr Bush is confronting the possibility of campaigning against a backdrop of American casualties and chaos in the war he began . So in the topsy turvy world of presidential politics x Mr Bush was talking up the economy x the very issue that Democrats have long argued would make him a one term president . And Democrats were hammering Mr Bush on the very subject that many Republicans argued would guarantee his re election: foreign policy . This could very well prove to be a passing moment in the larger struggle of whether the course of this campaign will be determined more by foreign policy or by the economy . Still x over the last few days there has clearly been an across the board recalibration by Democrats and Mr Bush as they try to keep up x and capitalize on x the changing landscape . So in Alabama on Monday x Mr Bush combined a somber declaration of perseverance in Iraq with a jaunty assessment of the economy . Remember this last week x the surprising announcement x at least x it confounded some of the experts x that our third quarter economic growth was vibrant x and that's good x he said . Inflation is down x and that's good . After tax incomes are up . People are keeping more of their own money x and that's really important for economic growth . Several Democrats x meanwhile x moved to retool their message on the economy to account for the new economic figures . Senator John Edwards of North Carolina x who campaigned in Iowa on Monday x said in a telephone interview that the growth figures would mean (little) not Americans who remain worried about high unemployment . Out across the country x people are very worried about jobs x worried about their families x worried about the potential for a plant or facility close xhope we have a good economy . It doesn't change anything that I am saying or fighting about if we have a good economy . We still have a problem with health xcare for Americans x right . While the economic news may complicate the Democratic case against Mr Bush x some Democrats are still struggling to define their positions on Iraq . Dr . Dean x for one x argues that his opponents who favored the war resolution were now in an even weaker political position given the events in Iraq . I think it was going to be a big issue anyway x Dr . Dean said in a telephone interview from Iowa . But it certainly is going to be a more divisive issue among the Democrats x because things are clearly not go back now .

"251",63840,"New York State's unemployment insurance fund ran out of money last month x forcing the state to borrow $418 million so far from the federal government x according to the New York State Department of Labor . The state has told the federal government that it may have to borrow as much as $760 million .  The automatic federal loan means that unemployment benefits for jobless New Yorkers are not risk .  But it may prove expensive x because the most recent loan x on top of two last year x means that the state will have to pay interest on its borrowings x according to the federal Department of Labor . If it had not borrow money at the end of the year x New York would have (avoided) not interest charges of 6dot3 percent on its $231 million of earlier loans x the principal of which has been repaid . And if all the money the state borrows is not entirely repaid by November 2004 x New York businesses face an automatic tax increase under Labor Department rules . That would be on top of an increase in state unemployment taxes that this year will cost companies an average of $50 more per employee x the state's Labor Department said . The increase x to an average of $360 per worker x is automatically imposed when the unemployment insurance fund goes into the red . Gov . George E . Pataki x who presents his budget today x has said he is opposed to job killing taxes x and he has even proposed small tax cuts or incentives for businesses to create jobs in New York . Texas is the only other state in the current recession that has needed federal help to pay its jobless benefits x although Minnesota has signaled federal officials that it may need a loan . New York State's unemployment insurance program provides up to six months of benefits for jobless people who qualify . the maximum payment is $405 a week .

As a result x through mid December of last year x the unemployment xtrust fund paid out roughly $650 million more in benefits than it did in the same period of 2001 x according to internal fund documents supplied by the New York Unemployment Project x a frequent critic of the state's jobless programs .

Money from taxes climbed by about $213 million . the state also received $491 million from a one time federal distribution x some of which went to pay off the outstanding loans . Mr Rosen contends that the fund's problems were caused not simply by the sharp increase in joblessness x but also by the Pataki administration's decisions to reduce unemployment insurance taxes on businesses and keep the fund's reserves low compared with the reserves in the funds of most other states . It's crucial that people understand that the state made bad tax choices x and that unemployed people are paying the price x Mr Rosen said . Had tax rates remained at 1994 levels x he said x the state would have billions of dollars for benefits or services for the jobless . The money would also be available to cover more unemployed workers x Mr Rosen said . Fewer than half of all New Yorkers who lose the xcouncil .

In any case x the rise in inflation over the last four months has lasted long enough to convince many economists that the Federal Reserve must soon raise interest rates x probably when the Fed's policy makers meet in late June x to demonstrate that they are willing to slow the economy and dilute the price pressures .

"258",64140,"By any number of measures x from Broadway ticket sales to new hiring at banks x economists say that New York's economy is rebounding . And while they hesitate to call it a boom x they do predict more prosperous times for at least the next year .  The new economic vitality is showing up in all kinds of ways: rising profits on Wall Street x higher than expected bridge and tunnel toll receipts x busier restaurants x even a run on high end shampoo .  So if Mayor Michael R . Bloomberg was a xlittle late last week when he pronounced New York's nearly three year old recession officially dead or at least on the wane x he ran into (little) not disagreement .  ''The city economy is truly springing into spring ,'' said Marc Goloven x senior regional economist for JP Morgan Chase and the author of a monthly newsletter on the city economy .  Since last xfall most economists have been predicting the end of the city's recession x but in a number of reports issued in the past weeks x they have seen their forecasts borne out . While some experts see the recovery as fragile x job creation over all has been anemic x and unemployment remains much higher than in the rest of the country x most say they expect it to continue for the near future .  ''Once it's started x it's like the Queen Mary ,'' said Rae D . Rosen x an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank in New York . ''It tends to keep going for a couple years .''  Like an ocean liner trying to reverse course x the city economy has waited a long time for this turnaround . Although the nation's recession ended x by most estimates x in late 2001 x the city's dragged on for another two years x largely because of the lingering fallout of the 9/11 attacks x said John Tepper Marlin x chief economist for the New York City comptroller's office . He and other experts said they believe New York's recession finally expired in the last quarter of 2003 .  Wall Street x which drives the city's economy to a large degree x has led the way to recovery x with profits rebounding last year to $16 .8 billion x the highest total since 2000 x when profits hit $21 billion . Banks are also planning to hire hundreds of workers this year x job recruiters say .  That is important x Ms Rosen said x because workers in finance spend heavily x so that for every job created on Wall Street x two are created elsewhere .  As in every New York recovery x though x the big question is whether that new money is coursing into the cash registers and wallets of other New Yorkers . And the answer is a qualified yes . A variety of other measures are showing gains x though not of them are strong x and the overall city economy has not returned to the robust levels of 2000 .  The city's economy grew 2dot9 percent in the last quarter of 2003 x its highest growth rate since the second quarter of 2000 x according to the city comptroller .  Tourists from elsewhere in the United States are flocking back x an estimated 36 .5 million leisure travelers last year x edging past the record 36 .4 million in 1999 . But the number of tourists from other countries has decline to x4dot8 million last year from 6dot8 million in 2000 . The increase in travel is filling hotels . Occupancy rates rose to 76 percent last year from 73 percent in 2001 x with preliminary figures for March showing the rate as high as 85 percent .  Gross ticket sales on Broadway climbed to $721 million in 2002 03 from $666 million in 2000 01 .  The Metropolitan Transportation Authority reports that toll revenue in 2003 was $1 billion x about $5dot2 million more than expected . By contrast x 2002 revenue was $933 million x about $500 ,000 (less) not expected .  The recovery's ripple effect has even reached into stores like Ricky's x a chain that sells wigs x makeup x exotic shampoos and costumes . Although bad weather in January and February has dampened sales somewhat this year x they increased last year by 5 percent x with clear signs that people are in the mood for pampering .  ''We are seeing the beauty supply end doingxwell'' said Todd Kenig x who owns the chain with his brother x Ricky . ''Shampoos x bath products x we sell high end shampoo x higher end hair care . They are doing great for us .''  Restaurantsxtoo x have seen business pick up x particularly in the past several months . Chuck Hunt x executive xvice president of the New York State Restaurant Association x said a variety of restaurateurs have reported better business x though tavern owners still complain that the city's antismoking law has hurt them .  ''I think we are headed toward regaining pre 9/11 numbers ,'' said Randy Garutti x general manager of Union Square Cafe x who estimates his business is up about 10 percent this year .  Recruiters for banking firms said business has rebounded considerably after a three year drought . ''There is definitely a surge ,'' said Helene Crocitto x executive xvice president at Filcro Financial Staffing x a Manhattan recruiting firm . ''A lot of companies that consolidated in the past now have a better handle and are now starting to hire again .''  Many jobs x she said x are at the executive level x '' a key sign that things are turning around .''  Economists x however x are closely watching for signs of broader improvement in the job market . The city's unemployment rate x which tends to lag behind other indicators x fell to 7dot9 percent in March x from 8 percent in February . The national rate was 5dot7 percent .  Joblessness was highest in the Bronx x with a 10 .5 percent unemployment rate x and lowest in Queens x with a 6dot9 percent rate .  Adolfo Carrion Jr . x the Bronx borough president x said the borough x the city's poorest x has traditionally lagged behind the rest of the city in employment x but predicted that a number of economic development projects x including the renovation of the Bronx Terminal Market x would improve the outlook there .  The city gained 700 private sector jobs in March x bringing the total to 2 ,988 ,600 x seasonally adjusted x according to the city comptroller's office analysis of federal labor statistics . That net job growth came mainly from the information industry and professional and business services x but it was not enough to offset job lose the xrecession began .Graphs track the following from 2000 2004:WALL STREET PROFITSHOTEL OCCUPANCY IN FEBRUARYGROSS CITY PRODUCT x QTR TO QTR PCT .

"259",64202,"When President Bush and his advisers talk about the widening federal budget deficit x they usually place part of the blame on economic shocks ranging from the recession of 2001 to the terrorist attacks that year .  But a report released on Monday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that economic weakness would account for only 6 percent of a budget shortfall that could reach a record $500 billion this year .  Next year x the agency predicted x faster economic growth will actually increase tax revenues even as the deficit remains at a relatively high level of $374 billion .  The new numbers confirm what many analysts have predicted for some time: that budget deficits in the decade ahead will stem (less) not from the lingering effects of the downturn and much more from rising government spending and progressively deeper tax cuts .  Administration officials do not dispute the basic thrust of the agency's estimate x but they still say that faster growth and spending restraints can reduce the deficit in five years .  Though the economy is growing at more than 4 percent a year x administration officials continue to attribute much of the budget deficit to economic problems beyond their control . ''Large and unwelcome as they are x the deficits are understandable ,'' Treasury Secretary John W . Snow said in a speech last week . ''They are understandable in the xsense that the president inherited a recession and an economy greatly weakened by the excesses of the late 90's .''  President Bush and his advisers almost routinely cite a list of shocks to the economy x from a recession that began as Mr Bush took office to the terrorist attacks and the lose their xxcontrol ,'' said Thomas S . Kahn x chief of staff for Democrats on the House Budget Committee . ''The CBO . report is confirmation that the Bush administration has locked us into long term structural deficits that will take some very tough decisions to wipe out .''  But J . T . Young x a spokesman for the White House budget office x said the administration was confident it could reduce the annual budget deficit by half over the next five years .  Mr Young cautioned that increases in tax revenues often lagged behind increased economic growth x and he noted that the budget was still being affected by higher costs for the military and domestic security .  ''The economic downturn was only one of the shocks ,'' Mr Young said . ''Even though the recession is over x we still have to spend what is necessary in the war on terrorism .''  Brian M . Reidl x a senior budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation x a conservative research group x said control over government spending would be crucial . He said the agency report projected a 42 percent rise in spending from 1999 through 2005 x but a tax revenue increase of only 19 percent . ''Economic booms are not forever x but government programs are ,'' Mr Reidl said . ''In the absence of real spending reform x the deficits are not down .''

"260",64272,"Manufacturing companies are more optimistic than they have been in four years x according to a report released on Thursday x but industry executives predicted that factories would add only a small number of jobs .  In an otherwise buoyant report x the National Association of Manufacturers predicted that factories would add 250 ,000 jobs in the next 12 months x (less) not 10 percent of the 2dot8 million they cut in the last three years .  And even that outlook may be optimistic . Manufacturing companies added barely xthat many jobs during the previous two economic recoveries x and productivity increases have been so high over the last year that demand for workers could climb more slowly than in the past . To be honest x I am (less) not sure about the employment numbers than I am about anything else in this report x said Jerry Jasinowski x president of the association x after releasing the forecast for this year . Even if the association's outlook turns out to be correct x it would reinforce the view of many economists that unemployment will decline to x5dot7 percent x that was mainly because more than 300 ,000 people stopped look xlike health xcare and banking have been expanding x that growth has been nowhere near enough to offset the jobs lose their xxwork forces and 13 percent expecting to reduce them .

The National Association of Realtors said home sales fell to an annual pace of 7 .09 million units in October x down from 7 .29 million in September x which was the second highest level ever . There were 2dot9 million single family houses x condominiums and co ops for sale in October x enough to keep the market supplied for 4dot9 months x up from 4dot6 months in September and the most since June 2003 x when there was a 5 month supply .  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had expected sales to fall to an annual pace of 7dot2 million .  The association estimated that sales would have fallen by an even greater 3dot2 percent in October x had it not for a surge in act xlike Baton Rouge x La . x and Jackson x Miss . x where evacuees from New Orleans and Mississippi coastal areas have bought homes since Hurricane Katrina struck at the end of August . Sales in the South fell 1dot8 percent over all x to an annual pace of 2dot8 million units .  Existing home sales reflect the closing of transactions that were entered into a month or more before .  Still x in an indication that demand for homes remains relatively strong x the median sales price x half the homes sold for more and half for (less) not x rose to $218 ,000 last month from $213 ,000 in September and was 16 .6 percent higher than a year earlier .  ''The evidence is consistent with a slowing housing market but one that is still very strong ,'' said Patrick Newport x an economist at the research firm Global Insight .  But even a moderate slowdown will have a noticeable impact on economic growth x Mr Newport indicated x because the rise in home values and the boom in mortgages has helped fuel consumer spending . ''There is (no) not around it ,'' he said . ''The housing market is going to be a drag on the economy next year .''  The latest data reinforced other recent measures of the housing market x like home construction x new home prices and mortgage applications . Economists and real estate industry officials link the slowing to a rise in interest rates and x in some hot markets x worries that prices have risen too xfast in a run of speculation .

Home sales were weakest in the Northeast x where they dropped 7dot4 percent x and strongest in the West x where they were down 1dot2 percent . Sales in the Midwest fell 1dot9 percent .  The Realtors' association characterized the sales drop as a healthy cooling of a heated market .

"263",64396,"Economic growth was a touch weaker in the second quarter than at first thought as consumers spent (less) not estimated and imports sated some of their appetite x the government said on Wednesday .  Separately x a gauge of business activity in the Midwest slumped in August x contracting for the first time in more than two years and suggesting that the economy may not on as firm a path as previously thought as it braces to deal with the fallout from Hurricane Katrina . The Midwest business barometer from the Institute for Supply Management fell to 49 .2 in August from 63 .5 in July x its lowest level since April 2003 .  Gross domestic product x a measure of all goods and services produced within the nation's borders x grew at a revised 3dot3 percent annual rate in the April June period after a 3dot8 percent first quarter gain x the Commerce Department said .  In its first snapshot a month ago x the department had put second quarter growth at 3dot4 percent x a figure economists had expected to be nudged up to 3dot5 percent .  The report showed that businesses added a bit to inventories x in contrast to a month ago when inventories were thought to have dropped .  Economists said this implied a xlittle (less) not pickup in production ahead for an economy that appears set to take at least a temporary hit from soaring energy prices .

"266",64565,"As further evidence of the growing cost of a life lived in New York City x the Consumer Price Index for the New York region inched up 0dot6 percent last month x triple the rate of inflation nationwide .  The index has risen 4dot1 percent in New York since the beginning of 2004 x compared with a 3 percent increase nationwide x according to the federal government x and far surpassing the increase in other cities x like Chicago x where the index rose 2dot4 percent between January 2004 and 2005 x and Los Angeles x where it rose 3dot7 percent .

Rising prices were led last month by housing and recreation x while the cost of food x especially produce x dropped a bit . Gasoline prices also fell 4dot5 percent last month . ''The entire index is now going up and other variables are going up ,'' Mr Dolfman said . ''Here we have the largest increase in the index in the country x and it is not due to gasoline .''

"275",65438,"When the dismal unemployment numbers were released on Friday (at the same time that oil prices were surging to record highs) x I thought about the young people at the bottom of the employment ladder .  Below the bottom x actually .  A shudder went through the markets when the Labor Department reported that the official jobless rate had jumped one half a percentage point in May to 5dot5 percent x the sharpest spike in 22 years .  The young people I am talking about wouldn't have noticed . These are the teenagers and young adults x roughly 16 to 24 years old x who are not school and basically have (no) not hope of finding work . The bureaucrats compiling the official unemployment rate don't even bother counting these young people . They are ((no) not one) not's constituency . They might as xwell not exist .  Except that they do exist . There are four million or more of these so called disconnected youths across the country . They hang out on street corners in cities large and small x and increasingly in suburban and rural areas .  If you ask how they survive from day to day x the most likely response is: ''I hustle ,'' which could mean anything from giving haircuts in a basement to washing a neighbor's car to running the occasional errand .  Or it could mean petty thievery or drug dealing or prostitution or worse .  This is the flip side of the American dream . The United States economy x which has trouble producing enough jobs to keep the middle class intact x has left these youngsters all but completely behind .  ''These kids are being challenged in ways that my generation was not ,'' said David Jones x the president of the Community Service Society of New York x which tries to develop ways to connect these young men and women with employment opportunities x or get them back into school .  It is extremely difficult because x for the most part x the jobs are not there and the educational establishment is having a hard enough time teaching the kids who are still in school .  ''Schools have not made much of an effort to bring this population back in ,'' said Mr Jones . ''Once you fall out of the system x you are basically on ((no) not one) not's programmatic radar screen .''  So these kids drift . Some are drawn to gangs . A disproportionate number become involved in crime . It is a tragic story x and very few people are xpay attention .  The economic policies of the past few decades have favored the wealthy and the wellxconnected to a degree that has been breathtaking to behold . The Nation magazine has devoted its current issue to the Gilded Age type inequality that has been the result .  Just a xlittle bit of help to the millions of youngsters trying to get their first tentative foothold in that economy should not too xmuch to ask .  It's not if these kids don't want to work . Many of them search and search until they finally become discouraged . The summer job market x which has long been an important first step in preparing teenagers for the world of work x is shaping up this year as the weakest in more than half a century x according to the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston .  Now x with the overall economy deteriorating x the situation for poorly educated young people will only grow worse . As Andrew Sum x director of the Center for Labor Market Studies x told The Times recently:  ''When you get into a recession x kids always get hit the hardest . Kids always go to the back of the hiring queue . Now x they find themselves with a lot of other people in line ahead of them .''  As the ranks of these youngsters grow x so does their potential to become a destabilizing factor in the society .  More important x the US needs the untapped talent (and the potential buying power) in this large pool of young people x just as it needs the talents of the many other Americans of all ages whose energy x intelligence and creativity are wasted in an economic system that is not geared toward providing jobs for everyone who wants to work .  America needs to dream bigger x and in this election year x job creation should be issue No . 1 . If I were running for president x I would pull together the smartest minds I could find from government x the corporate world x the labor movement x academia x the nonprofits and ordinary working men and women to see what could be done to spark the creation of decent jobs on a scale that would bring the US as close as possible to full employment .

"276",65445,"The European Central Bank x alarmed by soaring prices for food and fuel x warned unexpectedly Thursday that it might raise interest rates next month to counter an inflationary spiral .  Declaring the bank to be in a ''heightened state of alertness ,'' its president x Jean Claude Trichet x said that the risks to price stability had increased x and that the bank's governing council debated lifting the key rate at its meeting this week before voting to leave it at 4 percent .  The Bank of England also left rates unchanged at 5 percent x suggesting that its fears about inflation outweighed concerns about a slowing economy and a deteriorating housing market .  Neither central bank had been expected to move rates x but the significant hardening of the tone taken by the European Central Bank reverberated through the markets x sending the euro higher against the dollar and upending the forecasts of many bank watchers about the bank's near term policy .  ''They have set in motion a process that pushes the odds toward a hike in July ,'' said Thomas Mayer x chief European economist at Deutsche Bank in London . ''The hawks scored a goal today .''  The bank's governing council x Mr Trichet said x remains split about the need for an immediate rate increase to curb prices . But with fuel strikes and protests over the cost of food erupting from Portugal to Germany x the debate (no) (no longer) not whether to raise rates x but when .  Mr Trichet said any increase would be modest x on the order of a quarter of a percentage point .  Most economists had expected the bank to hold rates steady for the rest of this year x with possible reductions in 2009 x as Europe's economy reflected the weakness in the United States . For now x though x fears that oil and food prices will fuel an inflationary spiral have pushed aside worries about collateral damage from the credit crisis that began in the American housing market .  They have also overshadowed concerns about the strength of the euro against the dollar . Mr Trichet welcomed recent statements aimed at resuscitating the dollar by the Federal Reserve chairman x Ben S . Bernanke x and the Treasury secretary x Henry M . Paulson Jr . But the subject was xquick to combat inflation .  Alluding to the tensions in Europe x Mr Trichet said rising prices hurt people most at the bottom of the economic ladder .  Safeguarding price stability is the cardinal task of the European Central Bank x which celebrated its 10th anniversary this week with much talk of its success in combating inflation . But the latest numbers show how far inflation has broken beyond the bank's threshold of 2 percent .  In May x the inflation rate was 3dot6 percent x matching its record high for the period that the bank has managed monetary policy for the euro zone . The bank raised its staff projections for inflation to an average of 3dot4 percent for 2008 and 2dot4 percent for 2009 .  Even these forecasts x Mr Trichet said x are based on the optimistic assumptions that price increases for oil and other commodities will begin to moderate x and that so called second round effects x like steep increases in union negotiated wage contracts x can be (avoided) not .  Jorg Kramer x chief economist of Commerzbank in Frankfurt x said there was evidence that rising prices had already spilled over into labor negotiations in Germany . ''On the wage front ,'' he said x ''we have got problems for the first time in many years . It's wise for the ECB . to act xlike Germany are proving resilient x while others x like Ireland and Spain x are suffering from an American style collapse in their housing markets . For them x a rate increase will only add to the pain .  Mr Trichet x who likes to present a veneer of consensus x said the group had broken into three camps: those who wanted a rate increase now . those who wanted one later . and those who did not want one at all .  ''We had a very good and a very deep discussion ,'' he said x looking as if weeks had passed since Monday x the day of the bank's festive anniversary party xsupport for Mr Weber's campaign x especially if price pressures begin to ease .  ''The picture can change dramatically ,'' said Elga Bartsch x a senior European economist at Morgan Stanley in London . ''The recent sharp rise in oil prices seems to have come to a halt . Growth is probably going to slow further . There might be further wobbles in financial markets .''  The combination of rising prices and sluggish growth raises memories of the oil shock of the 1970s . Though Mr Trichet acknowledged similarities between that period and today x he cautioned against overdrawing the analogy . And he rejected suggestions that the bank was in danger of repeating the mistakes of its forebears in responding too xlate to the threat .  ''We are not behind the curve ,'' he said . ''We are correctly positioned .'' URL: http://www .nytimescom in Frankfurt with the bank's xvice president x Lucas D . Papademos .

"286",100235,"A series of car bombings devastated government institutions across Baghdad on Tuesday x provoking public and political denunciations of the country's xprime minister and the security forces he oversees . The attacks came as officials agreed at last to set a date in March for a national election .  The bombings x a coordinated assault on the capital x highlighted an ominous convergence of politics and violence x which American and Iraqi officials have long warned will mar the country's election . The vote x originally scheduled for January x was delayed by ethnic and sectarian disputes resolved only two days ago .  Five bombs x at least three detonated by suicide attackers x struck a courthouse x two colleges x a mosque and a bank . They created chaos across the city x locking down entire neighborhoods x overwhelming the police and rescue workers x and filling hospitals with the wounded . In one x a woman with her hair scorched and neck bloodied agonized as her child lay dying in a hallway .  At least 121 people were killed and more than 400 were wounded x according to police and hospital officials .  The attacks appeared intended to cripple the government's basic ability to function x and at least in part they succeeded . Two government institutions struck on Tuesday x the Finance Ministry and an xappeal court x had only just relocated to new buildings after similar attacks destroyed their old offices in August and October .  Many victims x standing amid debris and carnage x blamed Iraq's army and police force x which have taken charge of security as American forces have (withdraw) notawn from cities . They also linked the attacks to the protracted political jockeying over the election . ''Are we cursed .'' yelled a young woman near the mosque that was struck in Qahira x in northeast Baghdad . She had burns over her arms and legs . ''When will we be finished with this election issue .'' Prospective candidates blamed the security forces and the government for once again fail to xprotect the heart of Baghdad .  The attacks were the worst in Iraq since twin suicide bombings destroyed three government agencies on Oct 25 x killing at least 155 . They fit a pattern of spectacularly lethal attacks in the capital x followed by weeks of relative calm . In August x two suicide car bombs struck the country's Finance and Foreign Ministries x killing at least 122 . Those attacks became know xwell .  ''We can only hope that not every day will turn into Bloody Days ,'' Wathab Shakir x a Sunni lawmaker x declared during a stormy session of Parliament convened hours after the attacks .  The bombings underscored the inability of Iraq's security forces to stop carefully orchestrated attacks x despite an overwhelming presence at checkpoints that punctuate every major street in Baghdad .  Not one of dozens of lawmakers who fulminated in Parliament expressed any confidence in Iraq's security x a rare display of unity across political and sectarian divisions .  The session included calls for the resignations of senior military and police commanders x particularly the head of the Baghdad Operations Command x Gen . Aboud Qanbar x appointed by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al Maliki . ''The Iraqi government holds a xgreat deal of xresponsib for the bombings today and those in the past because of its negligence ,'' said Hassan al Shimary x a member of Parliament from Fadhila x a party that joined a Shiite led coalition challenging Mr Maliki in the coming election .  The blasts began shortly after 10 am and reverberated through the city for the next 50 minutes x sending enormous plumes of black smoke skyward . The first occurred in Dora x in southern Baghdad x when a suicide bomber detonated his car as he passed a police patrol near the entrance to a vocational college .  At least nine people were killed there x including three police officers . At least 31 others were hospitalized x many of them students . Broken glass x body parts x blood and sewage covered the street .  One of the deadliest attacks struck the headquarters of the Rafaidyan Bank downtown x where many workers from the Finance Ministry had moved after the ministry's building was destroyed in the August bombings . Dozens died there x though officials did not exact toll .  ''The bomber wanted numbers ,'' Capt . Saif al Dairi of the Federal Police said at the scene in Dora . ''He wanted to kill as many people as possible .''  American helicopters and surveillance drones circled the city in the immediate aftermath x while sporadic gunfire erupted . American soldiers x including explosives experts x joined Iraqi security forces responding to the attacks x a military spokesman x Maj . Joseph E . Scrocca x said in a statement .  In the attacks in August and October x Iraqi forces kept the Americans at arm's length x allowing them to play a minimal x and belated x role .  Another bomb struck a compound in western Baghdad that included the new offices of the Cassation Court x a federal xappeal court x was also damaged . art students poured from the building covered in bloodied dust .  ''They look xlike they had just risen from the tomb ,'' said Haydar Mohsin x a passer by .  The office of a former xprime minister x Ayad Allawi x is located 300 yards from that blast . Its windows were shattered x its doors wrenched from their jambs .  A spokeswoman for Mr Allawi x who has announced a political coalition with a senior secular Sunni leader x Saleh al Mutlaq x released a statement denouncing the fail to xstop such attacks . ''The government always forms investigation committees after each explosion x but it comes up with (nothing) not later ,'' the spokeswoman said .  Mr Maliki blamed ''the black fingerprints'' of the Baath Party and Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia x as he did after the August and October bombings .  ''The timing of these cowardly terrorist attacks that took place in Baghdad today x after the Parliament succeeded in overcoming the last obstacle to conducting elections x confirms that the enemies of Iraq and its people are aiming to create chaos in the country x blocking political progress and delaying the elections ,'' Mr Maliki said in a statement .

"287",100242,"Two synchronized suicide car bombings struck at the heart of the Iraqi government here on Sunday x severely damaging the Justice Ministry and provincial council complexes x leaving a scene of carnage that raised new questions about the government's ability to secure its most vital operations .  The bombers apparently passed through multiple security checkpoints before detonating their vehicles within a minute of each other x leaving at least 132 dead and more than 520 wounded strewn across crowded downtown streets . Blast walls had been moved back off the road in front of both buildings in recent weeks .  It was the deadliest coordinated attack in Iraq since the summer of 2007 and happened just blocks from where car bombers killed at least 122 people at the Foreign and Finance Ministries in August x in the continuation of a focused attempt by insurgents to strike at the government's most critical functions .  For months x Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al Maliki x who is seeking another term as Iraq prepares to hold national elections in January x has painstakingly tried to present Iraq as having turned a corner on the violence that threatened to tear the country apart in 2006 and 2007 .  He has recently ordered blast walls removed from dozens of streets in the capital and has insisted that Iraqi forces are capable of securing the country as American troops prepare to (withdraw) notaw entirely by the end of 2011 .  In large part x Mr Maliki's popularity has rested on the belief that he has kept the country reasonably safe .  But the bombings at four high profile x wellxprotected government buildings within a two month span led some Iraqis to say Sunday that they were reconsidering their support for Mr Maliki .  ''We don't want a government that does not provide us with security ,'' said Saif Adil x 26 x who has been unemployed since graduating from college two years ago . ''It was good for awhile x and now explose xopportunityy ,'' he said .  American Marines were seen walking around the debris filled streets after the attack . One Marine said the Americans had been asked by the Iraqi government to aid in the investigation .  Iraqi and American officials in Baghdad have repeatedly warned about a potential rise in violence as the Jan 16 parliamentary elections approach x as political parties and their allies vie for advantage and insurgent groups redouble their efforts to destabilize the country .  In a rare personal appearance at a bombing site x Prime Minister Maliki arrived at the provincial council building about an hour after the explosion x his face ashen as he surveyed the carnage .  Around Mr Maliki x paramedics carried the wounded to Red Crescent ambulances x workers wearing plastic gloves scooped body parts into plastic bags x and rescue teams pried open scorched cars in a desperate search for signs of life .  Surrounding streets had been blocked off and were under more than a foot of water because the blast had apparently also damaged a water main . Pools of water were red with blood .  Mr Maliki did not venture far from his armored sport utility vehicle . He made (no) not public comment before being driven away .  Mr Maliki later issued a statement calling the attacks ''cowardly'' and blamed elements of the Baath Party and the Sunni insurgent group Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia . He said the attack would not affect the elections .  President Jalal Talabani said the attackers had sought to damage Iraq's fragile democracy .  ''The perpetrators of this have revealed publicly that they are targeting the state and its basic pillars ,'' Mr Talabani said . ''They want to hinder the political process or to stop it and to sabotage what we have built during six years with great sacrifice .''  The two government buildings x typically filled with officials as xwell as civilians seeking government help x are on Haifa Street in one of Baghdad's most congested sections . Nearby are other Iraqi government buildings x embassies x the heavily fortified Green Zone and bridges crossing the Tigris River .  The explosion at the provincial council building collapsed a section of a 12 foot high blast wall x crushing people underneath x witnesses said .  The Iraqi police said the first bomb struck the Justice Ministry building around 10:30 am It blew out the building's large windows that overlook Haifa Street x sending flying glass and shrapnel into passers by . A plume of black smoke that rose over the city could be seen for miles .  ''I was eating in a restaurant near the Justice Ministry when a huge explosion took place ,'' said Sa'ad Saleem x 28 x an employee of Iraq's state owned television channel x who had shrapnel wounds in his neck and chest . ''The entire scene was filled with bloody human flesh . Large pools of blood were everywhere x in addition to the remains of burned cars . It was horrible .''  At the provincial council building x Sheik Hadi Salih x 60 x had been attending a meeting on the second floor when he heard the sound of an explosion x followed by the collapse of the ceiling .  ''We tried to find our way out down the stairs x and as we went we found many dead bodies ,'' he said . ''I have seen 20 bodies and more than 60 injured .''

"288",100257,"OPEN  An Autobiography  By Andre Agassi  Illustrated . 386 pp . Alfred A . Knopf . $28 .95  Even those not convinced that Andre Agassi was the best tennis player of his time will readily admit he outdid all others in attracting attention x beginning in the 1980s x when he was a teenage phenom from Las Vegas who blazed onto the pro tour in flamboyant x Nike sponsored plumage x stone washed denim x skintight ''Hot Lava'' compression shorts x midnight at the roulette wheel shades x that blinded many to the granite consistency of his game: the compact x bludgeoning ground strokes x the lethal service return x the lightning reflexes .  Now x three years into his retirement x Agassi's sterling accomplishments are again being obscured x this time by pre publication revelations from his autobiography x ''Open ,'' especially his admission that during one low period he found solace in crystal methamphetamine x supplied by his ''assistant ,'' and later lied about it to tennis officials x thus (avoiding) not three month suspension .  Given the current scandals involving steroids and human growth hormone x Agassi's infraction seems minor x even quaint x characterized as it was by late night binges that more likely retarded rather than ''enhanced'' his match day performances .  The more arresting news is that ''Open'' is one of the most passionately (anti) not sports books ever written by a superstar athlete x bracingly devoid of triumphalist homily and star spangled gratitude . Agassi's announced theme is that the game he mastered was a prison he spent some 30 years trying to escape . His first cell was the backyard court his immigrant father x Mike x built behind the family's ramshackle house in the parched outskirts of Las Vegas . Armenian x raised poor in Iran and employed as a ''captain ,'' or usher x at a casino on the Strip x Mike Agassi was determined to groom a champion and subjected all four of his children to abusive training x yanking them out of school for extra practice time . The three eldest all crumbled under the pressure . The jackpot came with the fourth x who was blessed with preternatural hand eye coordination x honed in daily sessions in which he swatted as many as 2 ,500 balls belched forth by a machine at speeds of up to 110 miles per hour x at angles so acute the 7 year old Andre had to swing the instant the ball landed x lest it bounce over his head x the trick of hitting ''on the rise'' that eventually would freeze opponents x helpless as even their most blistering shots came screaming back .  All this was nurturing x at least compared with his next incarceration x at the Florida tennis academy x or ''glorified prison camp ,'' operated by Nick Bollettieri x a sun baked entrepreneur paid thousands of dollars by parents who shipped their children off for months x even years x of incessant drilling x lectures on motivational psychology and nights spent in barracksxlike dorms . ''The constant pressure x the cutthroat competition x the total lack xin xmost instances paid for x in particular the company of two father figures x his physical trainer x Gil Reyes x and his coach x Brad Gilbert . Together they reconstructed Agassi's body and his game x and made possible his extraordinary x late career resurgence x when x at last finding joy in tennis x he briefly eclipsed his archrival x Pete Sampras x and staked his claim to being the era's dominant player . The numerology of pelt accumulation favors Sampras x who won 14 Grand Slam titles x seven of them at Wimbledon x and held a 20 14 advantage in head to head matches . But in his prime Agassi possessed the more complete game x suited to every surface (clay x grass x hardcourt) . He is one of only three men in the open era x and the only American man x to capture each of the four Grand Slam titles x compiling in one stretch (1999 2000) a record of 27 1 in successive majors x a ho hum burst of excellence in the brave new world of Roger Federer x though it was the best streak in 30 years x dating back to Rod Laver's full cycle of Grand Slam victories in 1969 .  In the twilight of his 21 year career x upon being told he had just played his 1 ,000th match x Agassi discovered x somewhat to his dismay x that he could recall them all . At times in ''Open'' he seems bent on reprising the full catalog x wins and lose the xoutset x that this showboat x with his garish costumes and presumed fatuity x was not clamoring for attention but rather conducting a struggle to wrest some semblance of selfhood from the sport that threatened to devour him .

"289",100292,"There are more marijuana stores here than public schools . Signs emblazoned with cannabis plants or green crosses sit next to dry cleaners x gas stations and restaurants .  The dispensaries range from Hollywood day spa fabulous to shoddy looking storefronts with hand painted billboards . Absolute Herbal Pain Solutions x Grateful Meds x Farmacopeia Organica .  Cannabis advocates claim that more than 800 dispensaries have sprouted here since 2002 . some law enforcement officials say it is closer to 1 ,000 . Whatever the real number x everyone agrees it is too xhigh .  And so thisxtoo x is taken for granted: Crackdowns on cannabis clubs will soon come in this city x which has more dispensaries than any other .  For the first time x law enforcement officials in Los Angeles have vowed to prosecute medical marijuana dispensaries that turn a profit x with police officials saying they expect to conduct raids . Their efforts are widely seen as a campaign to sway the City Council into adopting strict regulations after two years of debate .  It appears to be working . Carmen A . Trutanich x the newly elected city attorney x recently persuaded the Council to put aside a proposed ordinance negotiated with medical marijuana supporters for one drafted by his office . The new proposal calls for dispensaries to have renewable permits x submit to criminal record checks x register the names of members with the police and operate on a nonprofit basis . If enacted x it is likely to result in the closing of hundreds of marijuana dispensaries .  Mr Trutanich argued that state law permits the exchange of marijuana between growers and patients on a nonprofit and noncash basis only . Marijuana advocates say that interpretation would regulate dispensaries out of existence and thwart the will of voters who approved medical cannabis in 1996 .  Whatever happens here will be closely watched by law enforcement officials and marijuana advocates across the country who are threading their way through federal laws that still treat marijuana as an illegal drug and state laws that are increasingly allowing medicinal use . Thirteen states have laws supporting medical marijuana x and others are considering new legislation .  No state has gone further than California x often described by drug enforcement agents as a ''source nation'' because of the vast quantities of marijuana grown here . And (no) not city in the state has gone further than Los Angeles . This has alarmed local officials x who say that dispensary owners here took unfair advantage of vague state laws intended to create exceptions to marijuana prohibitions for a limited number of ill people .  ''About 100 percent of dispensaries in Los Angeles County and the city are operating illegally ,'' said Steve Cooley x the Los Angeles County district attorney x who is up for re election next year . ''The time is right to deal with this problem .''  Mr Cooley x speaking last week at a training luncheon for regional narcotics officers titled ''The Eradication of Medical Marijuana Dispensaries in the City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County ,'' said that state law did not allow dispensaries to be for profit enterprises .  Mr Trutanich x the city attorney x went further x saying dispensaries were prohibited from accepting cash even to reimburse growers for labor and supplies . He said that a recent California Supreme Court decision x People v . Mentch x banned all over the counter sales of marijuana . other officials and marijuana advocates disagree .  So far x prosecutions of marijuana dispensaries in Los Angeles have been limited to about a dozen in the last year x said Sandi Gibbons x a spokeswoman for Mr Cooley . But Police Department officials said they were expecting to be called on soon to raid collectives .  ''I don't think this is a law that we will have to enforce 800 times ,'' said one police official x who decline to xspeak on the record before the marijuana ordinance was completed . ''This is just like anything else . You don't have to arrest everyone who is speeding to make people slow down .''  Don Duncan x a spokesman for Americans for Safe Access x a leader in the medical marijuana movement x said that over the counter cash purchases should be permitted but that dispensaries should be nonprofit xorganized by security guards who check the required physicians' recommendations . Inside x the dispensary looks xlike a bank x except that the floor is covered with hemp carpeting and the eight tellers stand behind identical displays of marijuana and hashish .  There is a laboratory where technicians determine the potency of the marijuana and label it accordingly . (Harborside says it rejects 80 percent of the marijuana that arrives at its door for insufficient quality .) There is even a bank vault where the day's cash is stored along with reserves of premium cannabis . An armored truck picks up deposits every evening .  City officials routinely audit the dispensary's books . Surplus cash is rolled back into the center to pay for free counseling sessions and yoga for patients . ''Oakland issued licenses and regulations x and Los Angeles did (nothing) not and they are still unregulated ,'' Mr DeAngelo said . ''Cannabis is being distributed by inappropriate people .''  But even Oakland's regulations fall short of Mr Trutanich's proposal that Los Angeles ban all cash sales .  ''I don't know of any collective that operates in the way that is envisioned by this ordinance ,'' said Mr Duncan x of Americans for Safe Access .  Christine Gasparac x a spokeswoman for State Attorney General Jerry Brown x said that after Mr Trutanich's comments in Los Angeles x law enforcement officials and advocates from around the state had called seeking clarity on medical marijuana laws .  Mr Brown has issued legal guidelines that allow for nonprofit sales of medical marijuana x she said . But x she added x with laws being interpreted differently x ''the final answer will eventually come from the courts .'' URL: http://www .nytimescom","Negative",6044

Several are still going x including three educational x therapeutic and vocational programs run by the Horticultural Society of New York x of which Mrs Margolis was chairwoman of the board at her death .  A fourth program x developed under Mrs Margolis's supervision and also run by the Horticultural Society x is scheduled to start today . It will teach Rikers's adolescent inmates x 16 and 17 year old boys x how to turn a large field on the island into a community garden .  None of Mrs Margolis's associates interviewed last week could recall what first prompted her to volunteer in the city's jails in the early 1960s . Even her daughter was not completely certain . To those who knew her x Mrs Margolis was so utterly at home at Rikers that it seemed simply as if she had always been on the island x which is home to one of the largest penal complexes in the world .  Mrs Margolis worked mostly in the Eric M . Taylor Center x which houses male prisoners . In 1980 x she helped revive The Rikers Review x a magazine of literature x journalism and advice written and produced by inmates .  In 1989 x she founded Fresh Start x which she ran until 1997 . (Since then x Fresh Start has been administered by the Osborne Association x a nonprofit xorganized by volunteer guest instructors from restaurants in Manhattan .  Because alcohol is not allowed in the jail x inmates are trained in wine tasting using different varieties of grape juice . They are also taught knife skills x a highly unusual course in a penal institution . This has (never) not caused a problem x Elizabeth Gaynes x the executive director of the Osborne Association x said in a telephone interview on Thursday .  When Mrs Margolis began Fresh Start x few training programs xpaid attention to inmates once they were released x Jennifer Wynn x the author of ''Inside Rikers'' (St Martin's x 2001) x said in an interview on Friday .  Under Mrs Margolis's stewardship x efforts to prevent recidivism came not only in official form (Fresh Start offered participants therapy and drug counseling in prison and lifetime support on their release) but also in her own unofficial brand of attention to alumni .  ''She would call them x three weeks out x six weeks out x six months out ,'' said Ms Wynn x who was the director of Fresh Start from 2004 to 2007 . ''She would take phone calls from graduates at 10 o'clock at night . She would go to their weddings . If they needed a tie for an interview x she would get them a tie .''  About 25 percent of Fresh Start graduates return to jail within a year of their release x according to the Osborne Association . The recidivism figure for other city jail inmates within a year of release is about 46 percent x according to the New York City Department of Correction .  Barbara Ann Schneider x familiarly known as Bobbie x was born on Oct 4 x 1929 x in Malden x Mass . Her father x Eli x owned a drugstore and soda fountain . her mother x the former Shirley Selsky x was a homemaker .  Mrs Margolis earned a bachelor's degree in retailing from Simmons College in Boston . After an earlier marriage ended in divorce x she married Mr Margolis in 1958 .  Mr Margolis x the retired president and chairman of Colt Industries (later Coltec) x a maker of firearms x aerospace equipment and other machinery x died in December .  Besides her daughter x Nancy x Mrs Margolis is xsurvived by three sons x Brian x Robert and Peter . a sister x Arline Guefen . and five grandchildren .  A past member of the New York City Board of Correction x Mrs Margolis served on the boards of many organizations x among them the Vera Institute of Justice and the New York City Criminal Justice Agency .  Perhaps the greatest sign of the esteem in which Mrs Margolis was held came from the prisoners themselves .

Mrs Shaw was born in Hartford x Connecticut x on January 15 x 1927 to parents of Armenian descent . Her shopkeeper father x like many immigrants of that time x believed in the American Dream and told his daughter that she could make anything of herself in this country .

Immediately afterward she passed the Massachusetts bar exam with the highest score to that date .

She used her knowledge of the law and her devotion to child welfare to help found Community Attention x group homes that provided adolescent offenders an alternative to more punitive x and (less) not effective x detention facilities . This rehabilitation option was controversial at the time but proved extremely effective in lowering recidivism rates and became a much replicated model . During these years Mrs Shaw also chaired the board that oversaw the regional jail x taught law through the University of Virginia to law enforcement and security officers and advised the governor of Virginia on juvenile justice issues . She and Dr . Shaw moved to Pasadena x California x in 1981 x where she joined the ranks of volunteers at CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) in Los Angeles . Though only five feet tall x she often traveled alone into many of the city's roughest neighborhoods to interview relatives of children whose fate lay with the courts so she could represent those children as effectively as possible . Her tireless advocacy moved Los Angeles County to name her its Volunteer of the Year in 1994 . She discovered late in life that she loved (nothing) not zipping around icebergs and glaciers in an inflatable Zodiac boat in the Arctic and Antarctic x and she and Dr .

"298",100539,"x a 60 pound x year old Staffordshire bull terrier with a silver gray coat and blue eyes . But the only thing tough about him was his name x his owner said .  Tyson followed commands x (never) not bit anyone and liked to put his paws on people's heads to play with their hair . ''He was a big baby ,'' said his owner x Marc Hernandez x 20 x who had had Tyson since he was a puppy of 7 weeks .  Yet one day in May x Mr Hernandez x a student at John Jay College of Criminal Justice x took Tyson to an East Harlem animal shelter x where he reluctantly and tearfully surrendered him . The problem was not Tyson's behavior x but his home: Mr Hernandez lives in one of New York City's public housing projects x where a ban on pit bulls and other large dogs went into effect May 1 .  The ban x one of the strictest for any public housing authority in the country x prohibits residents from keeping pure bred or xmix with the exception of service dogs x expected to weigh more than 25 pounds when grown .  It has divided tenants and outraged animal welfare groups .  For the New York City Housing Authority x keeping track of the pets in 178 ,000 apartments has been a challenge . But the way the agency announced the policy and the way it has enforced it has confused and angered many .  Under the 14 page policy x residents who already owned dogs on the outlawed list could keep them if they were registered by May 1 x but many tenants fail to xdo so and were forced x like Mr Hernandez x to choose between keeping their dogs or their apartments .  Since April x the owners of at least 113 dogs have given them up x citing the ban x to shelters and centers run xagainst residents for violating the pet policy . Nine cases have been resolved x Mr Marder said: Some were (withdraw) notawn at the housing manager's request and one tenant gave a dog to a friend . The 32 others are pending .  The agency announced the rules by publishing a notice in the April issue of its monthly newspaper . But that notice listed 27 prohibited breeds x including the Shar Pei x the cane corso and the dogo Argentino . Mr Marder said the agency had tried to identify breeds that exceed 25 pounds when grown x but realized that the long list was ''impractical'' and cut it to three .  Tenants have received verbal and written warnings about their dogs from housing managers . An employee instruction guide on using the agency's computerized program of pet tracking is 37 pages long x and maintenance workers who go into apartments to make repairs make a note of any pets in the household x Mr Marder said .  Mr Hernandez x who lives with his mother at Mariana Bracetti Plaza in the East Village x took Tyson into the management office the day before the ban started x but Tyson could not registered because he also exceeded the previous weight limit x infrequently enforced x of 40 pounds .  Mr Hernandez said he feared that he and his mother would be evicted if he kept Tyson . ''I got scared x so of course I am going to do it ,'' he said .

"299",100556,"In most states x if somebody is texting behind the wheel and causes a crash that injures or kills someone x the penalty can be as light as a fine .  Utah is much tougher .  After a crash here that killed two scientists x and prompted a dogged investigation by a police officer and local victim's advocate x Utah passed the nation's toughest law to crack down on texting behind the wheel . Offenders now face up to 15 years in prison .  The new law x which took effect in May x penalizes a texting driver who causes a fatality as harshly as a drunken driver who kills someone . In effect x a crash caused by such a multitasking motorist is (no) (no longer) not considered an ''accident'' like one caused by a driver who x say x runs into another car because he nodded off at the wheel . Instead x such a crash would now be considered inherently reckless .  ''It's a willful act xlike drunken driving raises complex legal questions . Drunken drivers can be identified using a Breathalyzer . But there is (no) not immediate test for driving while texting . such drivers could deny they were doing so x or claim to have been dialing a phone number . (Many legislators have thus far made a distinction between texting and dialing x though researchers say dialing creates many of the same risks .)  If an officer or prosecutor wants to confiscate a phone or phone records to determine whether a driver was texting at the time of the crash x such efforts can be thwarted by search and seizure and privacy defenses x lawyers said .  Prosecutors and judges in other states already have the latitude to use more general reckless driving laws to penalize multitasking drivers who cause injury and death . In California x for instance x where texting while driving is banned but the only deterrent is a $20 fine x a driver in April received a six year prison sentence for gross vehicular manslaughter when x speeding and texting x she slammed into a line of cars waiting at a construction zone x killing another driver .  But if those prosecutors want to charge a texting driver with recklessness x they must prove the driver knew of the risks before sending texts from behind the wheel .  In Utah x the law now assumes people understand the risks .  The law ''is very noteworthy ,'' said Anne Teigen x a policy xspecial force states to ban texting while driving .  Utah x governed by a Republican legislature with a libertarian bent x may seem an unlikely state to pursue particularly tough penalties governing driver behavior .  But the issue forced itself onto the legislative agenda here because of what occurred on the rainy morning of Sept 22 x 2006 .  The accident occurred on a two lane highway just west of Logan x in a verdant valley in Utah's northernmost county .  Reggie Shaw x a 19 year old college student working as a house painter x was driving west to work in a Chevrolet Tahoe SUV . Approaching him x in a Saturn sedan x was James Furaro x 38 x and his passenger x Keith P . O'Dell x 50 . The senior scientists were commuting to ATK Launch Systems x where they were helping to design and build rocket boosters .  Mr Shaw crossed the yellow dividing line on the two lane road and clipped the Saturn . It spun across the highway and was struck by a pickup truck hauling a trailer filled with two tons of horseshoes and related equipment .  The two scientists were killed instantly .  At the scene x the investigating officer x Bart Rindlisbacher of the Utah Highway Patrol x said he could not pinpoint the cause of the crash . Mr Shaw said he could not remember doing anything out of the ordinary .  The trooper figured it was an unfortunate case of ''left of center ,'' a catch all for a traffic offense that involves crossing the yellow divider .  But a witness told the police he had seen Mr Shaw swerving several times just before the accident x raising Mr Rindlisbacher's suspicions . The trooper's concerns grew as he drove Mr Shaw to the hospital . He saw Mr Shaw x in the passenger seat x pull out his phone and start texting .  ''Were you texting while you were driving .'' Mr Rindlisbacher recalled asking .  ''No ,'' he recalled Mr Shaw responding . (Mr Shaw said he did not remember the conversation or much about the accident .)  The trooper was deeply skeptical . He figured out how to subpoena Mr Shaw's phone records . Six months later x with help from a state public safety investigator x they got the records and their proof: Mr Shaw and his girlfriend had sent 11 text messages to each other in the 30 minutes before the crash x the last one at 6:47 am x a minute before Mr Shaw called 911 . Investigators concluded he sent that last text when he crossed the yellow line .  Still x county prosecutors thought they were unable to xcharge Mr Shaw with something other than ''left of center .'' For instance x if they wanted to prove Mr Shaw guilty of negligent homicide x a misdemeanor x they would need to show he knew of the dangers or should have known of the dangers of texting while driving .  Mr Shaw x who had retained a lawyer x would not discuss the issue with law enforcement or prosecutors .  Then Terryl Warner x a victim's advocate in the county where the accident occurred x got involved .  Ms Warner had a personal interest in the case because she knew the family of one of the scientists .  In July 2007 x Ms Warner x convinced by the trooper's evidence x wrote to prosecutors arguing for a vehicular manslaughter charge . She said the dangers of texting and driving were broadly known x therefore Mr Shaw should have known better .  Mr Shaw had just started a Mormon mission in Canada when he was called home to face charges of negligent homicide . The trial was set for early 2009 .  Then x just before Thanksgiving in 2008 x at a hearing x Mr Shaw look xlike the book's character Jean Valjean x how to make a contribution to society .  Last February x Mr Shaw spoke to the state House Subcommittee on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice x which was considering a ban on texting for motorists . The measure seemed likely to fail to xtalk about his crash and started sobbing .  ''I was the one driving and texting ,'' Mr Shaw said through tears . ''Excuse me . I apologize . I didn't know the dangers .''  Ms Warner x the victim's advocate x said that moment was a turning point . ''Before he spoke x some legislators were talking and texting ,'' she recalled . ''After he started talking x there wasn't a dry eye in the room .''  Under Utah's law x someone caught texting and driving now faces up to three months in jail and up to a $750 fine x a misdemeanor . If they cause injury or death x the punishment can grow to a felony and up to a $10 ,000 fine and 15 years in prison .  Alaska is the only other state that takes a similarly tough approach to electronic distraction x said Ms Teigen of the National Conference of State Legislators .  A law passed there in 2007 makes it a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison if a driver causes a fatal accident when a television x video monitor or computer is on inside the car and in the driver's field of vision . (The law applies to phones used for texting x but not phones used exclusively for calling or to some other devices x like GPS devices .)  The law x which is (less) not focused on texting than Utah's x resulted from a 2003 accident in which a driver x who prosecutors said was watching a movie on a video monitor perched on his dashboard x killed two motorists .  These tougher penalties can lead to prickly legal questions .  John Wesley Hall x who just stepped down as president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers x said the police might have difficulty proving a driver suspected of texting wasn't merely dialing a phone . And x he said x there are serious privacy and search issues raised when an officer wants to confiscate a phone .  ''The police have (no) not business going into my phone ,'' he said .  James Swink x the Cache County attorney x expects such challenges x but says that the police in some cases could simply get phone records later x as in the Shaw case .  More broadly x Mr Swink said x drivers in Utah are now on notice that texting while driving is inherently reckless . And as drivers across the nation become more aware of that notion x he said x judges and prosecutors will feel more comfortable asking for big penalties . He said the Shaw case helped to pave the way .  ''Once the word is out there ,'' he said x ''it will become easier for judges to lower the big boom .''

"300",100599,"''IT is time to water the tree of liberty'' said the sign carried by a gun toting protester milling outside President Obama's town hall meeting in New Hampshire two weeks ago . The Thomas Jefferson quote that inspired this message x of course x said (nothing) not about water: ''The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants .'' That's the beauty of a gun x you don't have to spell out the ''blood .''  The protester was a nut . America has (never) not shortage of them . But what's Tom Coburn's excuse . Coburn is a Republican senator from Oklahoma x where 168 people were murdered by right wing psychopaths who bombed a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995 . Their leader x Timothy McVeigh x had the Jefferson quote on his T shirt when he committed this act xlike Hamas . Why . The far right x in league with the National Rifle Association x was angry at the federal government for aggressively policing America's self appointed militias . In a 1996 floor speech x Coburn conceded that ''terrorism obviously poses a serious threat ,'' but then went on to explain that the nation had worse threats to worry about: ''There is a far greater fear that is present in this country x and that is fear of our own government .'' As his remarks on ''Meet the Press'' last week demonstrated x the subsequent intervention of 9/11 has not changed his worldview .  I have been writing about the simmering undertone of violence in our politics since October x when Sarah Palin x the vice presidential candidate of a major political party x said (nothing) not condemn Obama haters shrieking ''Treason . ,'' ''Terrorist .'' and ''Off with his head .'' at her rallies . As vacation beckons x I would like to drop the subject x but the atmosphere keeps getting darker .  Coburn's implicit rationalization for far right fanatics bearing arms at presidential events x the government makes them do it . x can not stand . He's not radio or Fox News bloviator paid a fortune to be outrageous . he's a card carrying member of the United States Senate . On Monday x the day after he gave a pass to those threatening violence x a dozen provocateurs with guns x at least two of them bearing assault weapons x showed up for Obama's VFW . speech in Phoenix . Within hours x another member of Congress x Phil Gingrey of Georgia x was telling Chris Matthews on MSNBC that as long as brandishing guns is legal x hextoo x saw (no) not reason to discourage Americans from showing up armed at public meetings .  In April the Department of Homeland Security issued a report x originally commissioned by the Bush administration x on the rising threat of violent right wing extremism . It was ridiculed by conservatives x including the Republican chairman x Michael Steele x who called it ''the height of insult .'' Since then x a neo Nazi who subscribed to the (anti) not Obama ''birther'' movement has murdered a guard at the Holocaust museum in Washington x and an (anti) not abortion zealot has gunned down a doctor in a church in Wichita x Kan .  This month the Southern Poverty Law Center x the same xorganized by Democrats on this crowd's holy Second Amendment . Since taking office x Obama has disappointed gun control advocates by relegating his campaign pledge to reinstate the ban on assault weapons to the down low .  No x the biggest contributor to this resurgence of radicalism remains panic in some precincts about a new era of cultural and demographic change . As the sociologist Daniel Bell put it x ''What the right as a whole fears is the erosion of its own social position x the collapse of its power x the increasing incomprehensibility of a world x now overwhelmingly technical and complex x that has changed so drastically within a lifetime .''  Bell's analysis appeared in his essay ''The Dispossessed ,'' published in 1962 x between John Kennedy's election and assassination . JFK . x (no) not leftist than Obama x was the first Roman Catholic in the White House and the tribune of a new liberal order . Bell could have also written his diagnosis in 1992 x between Bill Clinton's election and the Oklahoma City bombing . Clinton x like Kennedy and Obama x brought liberals back into power after a conservative reign and represented a generational turnover that stoked the fears of the dispossessed .  While Bell's essay remains relevant in 2009 x he could not vice presidential candidate down x would either enable or endorse a radical and armed fringe . Nor could he have imagined that so many conservative intellectuals would remain silent . William F . Buckley did make an effort to distance National Review from the John Birch Society . The only major conservative writer to repeatedly and forthrightly take on the radical right this year is David Frum . He ended a recent column for The Week x titled ''The Reckless Right Courts Violence ,'' with a plea that the president ''be met and bested on the field of reason ,'' not with guns .  Those on the right who defend xagainst Obama x according to Kessler x are up 400 percent from those against his White House predecessor .  But as we learned in Oklahoma City 14 years ago x or at the wellxprotected Holocaust museum just over two months ago x this kind of irrational radicalism has a myriad of targets . And it is impervious to reason . Much as Coburn fought an antiterrorism bill after the carnage of Oklahoma City x so three men from Bagdad x Ariz . x drove 2 ,500 miles in 1964 to testify against a bill tightening federal controls on firearms after the Kennedy assassination . As the historian Richard Hofstadter wrote in his own famous Kennedy era essay x ''The Paranoid Style in American Politics ,'' these Arizona gun enthusiasts were convinced that the American government was being taken over by a ''subversive power .'' Sound familiar .  Even now the radicals are taking a nonviolent toll on the Obama presidency . Obama complains x not (without) not reason x that the news media x led by cable television x exaggerate the ruckus at health xcare events . But why does he exaggerate the legitimacy and clout of opposition members of Congress who x whether through silence or outright endorsement x are surrendering to the nuts . Even Charles Grassley x the supposedly adult Iowa Republican who is the Senate point man for his party on health xcare x has now capitulated to the armed fringe by publicly parroting their ''pull the plug on grandma'' fear mongering .  For all the talk of Obama's decline to xthe president's 41 percent) . Should Obama fail to xdeliver serious reform because his administration treats the pharmaceutical and insurance industries as deferentially as it has the banks x that would be shameful . Should he fail to xa decimated opposition party that has sunk and shrunk to its craziest common denominator x that would be ludicrous .  The GOP . x whose ranks have now dwindled largely to whites in Dixie and the (less) not populated West x is not paper tiger x it's a paper muskrat . James Carville is correct when he says that if Republicans actually carried out their filibuster threats on health xcare x it would be a political bonanza for the Democrats .  In last year's campaigndebates x Obama liked to cite his unlikely Senate friendship with Tom Coburn x of all people x as proof that he could work with his adversaries . If the president insists that enemies like this are his friends x and that the nuts they represent can be placated by reason x he will waste his opportunity to effect real change and have ((no) not one) not blame but himself .

"302",100637,"An Iranian American scholar x Kian Tajbakhsh x already serving a 15 year prison sentence for spying x is facing a new charge of spying x a family member said Wednesday .  Mr Tajbakhsh told his wife during a visit at Evin prison in Tehran that he was taken before the Revolutionary Court on Monday x where a judge read new charges against him of ''spying for the George Soros foundation ,'' a reference to the Open Society Institute x a pro democracy group founded by Mr Soros x a prominent financier and philanthropist . The accusation was brought by the intelligence section of the Revolutionary Guards x said the family member x who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of complicating the case .

He was also charged with belonging to the Gulf/2000 Project x an e mail list of scholars x journalists x diplomats and businessmen with interests in the Persian Gulf region .

"307",100861,"An American military detention camp in Afghanistan is still holding inmates x sometimes for weeks at a time x (without) not access to the International Committee of the Red Cross x according to human rights researchers and former detainees held at the site on the Bagram Air Base .  The site x known to detainees as the black jail x consists of individual windowless concrete cells x each illuminated by a single light bulb glowing 24 hours a day . In interviews x former detainees said that their only human contact was at twice daily interrogation sessions .  ''The black jail was the most dangerous and fearful place ,'' said Hamidullah x a spare parts dealer in Kandahar who said he was detained there in June . ''They don't let the ICRC officials or any other civilians see or communicate with the people they keep there . Because I did not know what time it was x I did not know when to pray .''  The jail's operation highlights a tension between President Obama's goal to improve detention conditions that had drawn condemnation under the Bush administration and his stated desire to give military commanders leeway to operate . While Mr Obama signed an order to eliminate so called black sites run xagainst the grain of the administration's commitment to greater transparency x accountability x and respect for the dignity of Afghans ,'' said Jonathan Horowitz x a human rights researcher with the Open Society Institute .  Mr Horowitz said he understood that ''the necessities of war requires the US to detain people x but there are limits to how to detain .''  The black jail is separate from the larger Bagram detention center x which now holds about 700 detainees x mostly in cages accommodating about 20 men apiece x and which had become notorious to the Afghan public as a symbol of abuse . That center will be closed by early next year and the detainees moved to a new larger detention site as part of the administration's effort to improve conditions at Bagram .  The former detainees interviewed by The Times said they were held at the site for 35 to 40 days . All three were sent there upon arriving at Bagram and eventually transferred to the larger detention center on the base x which allows access to the Red Cross . The three were hooded and handcuffed when they were taken for questioning at the black jail so they did not know where they were or anything about other detainees x they said .  Mr Horowitz said he had heard similar descriptions of the jail from former detainees x as had Sahr MuhammedAlly x a lawyer with Human Rights First x a nonprofit organization that has tracked detention issues in Guantanamo Bay x Cuba x Iraq and Afghanistan .  The International Committee of the Red Cross does not discuss its findings publicly and would not say whether its officials had visited the black jail . But x in early 2008 x military officials acknowledged receiving a confidential complaint from the ICRC that the military was holding some detainees incommunicado .  In August x the military said that it had begun to give the Red Cross the names of everyone detained x including those held in the Special Operations camps x within two weeks of capture . But it still does not allow the group face to face access to the detainees .  All three detainees said the hardest part of their detention was that their families did not know whether they were alive .  ''For my whole family it was disastrous ,'' said Hayatullah x a Kandahar resident who said he was working in his pharmacy when he was arrested . ''Because they knew the Americans were sometimes killing people x and they thought they had killed me because for two to three months they didn't know where I was .''  The three detainees said the military had mistaken them for Taliban fighters .  ''They kept saying to me x 'Are you Qari Idris .' '' said Gulham Khan x 25 x an impoverished x illiterate sheep trader x who mostly delivers sheep and goats for people who buy the animals in the livestock market in Ghazni x the capital of the province of the same name . He was captured in late October 2008 and released in early September this year x he said .  ''I said x 'I am not Qari Idris .' But they kept asking me over and over x and I kept saying x 'I am Gulham . This is my name x that is my father's name x you can ask the elders .' ''  Ten months after his initial detention x American soldiers went to the group cell where he was then being held and told him he had been mistakenly picked up under the wrong name x he said .  ''They said x 'Please accept our apology x and we are sorry that we kept you here for this time .' And that was it . They kept me for more than 10 months and gave me (nothing) not back .''  In their search for him x Mr Khan's family members spent the equivalent of $6 ,000 x a fortune for a sheep dealer x who often makes just a dollar a day . Some of the money was spent on bribes to local Afghan soldiers to get information on where he was being held . they said soldiers took the money and (never) not came back with the information .  In Mr Hamidullah's case x interrogators at the black jail insisted that he was a Taliban fighter named Faida Muhammad . ''I said x 'That's not me ,' '' he recalled .  ''They blamed me and said x 'You are making bombs and are a facilitator of bomb making and helping militants ,' '' he said . ''I said x 'I have a shop .

"309",100917,"The San Francisco board of supervisors voted Tuesday to overturn a city policy that has been at the center of a national debate over offering illegal immigrants sanctuary .  The policy x ordered by Mayor Gavin Newsom last summer x requires the police to contact Immigration and Customs Enforcement whenever they arrest a juvenile on felony charges who they suspect is in the United States illegally . Since the policy took effect last summer x more than 100 undocumented minors have been turned over to federal immigration authorities .  Mr Newsom has said the ordinance is necessary to prevent young criminals from using the city's so called sanctuary policy x which prevents the use of city money for immigration enforcement .  ''Sanctuary city was (never) not designed to protect people who commit crimes ,'' said Nathan Ballard x a spokesman for Mr Newsom .  But under the changes approved Tuesday x referrals would be required only after juveniles were convicted of crimes x instead of after their arrest . Immigration advocates say that referrals upon arrest have resulted in the deportation of innocent youths x the breakup of families and a fear among immigrants of contacting the police when they are the victims of crime .  ''We recognize that there's a need to do some reporting'' of illegal juveniles x said David Campos x the supervisor who sponsored the new ordinance . ''But we are trying to strike a balance .''  Tuesday's meeting was filled to capacity x with hundreds of supporters of Mr Campos's bill filling the board's chambers and two overflow rooms . Simultaneous translation of supervisors' comments were offered in Mandarin and Spanish x and when the bill was passed x by 8 to 2 with one absentee x cheers erupted in the chambers x with chants of ''Yes We Can'' in English and Spanish echoing through the ornate City Hall .  Supporters continued chanting as they filed out past a bust of Harvey Milk x the trailblazing San Francisco supervisor and gay rights advocate whose name was invoked by supporters of Mr Campos's bill .  The vote was a sharp rebuke to Mr Newsom x a Democrat who is running for governor and who has promised to veto it x though supporters seem to have enough votes to overturn that .  San Francisco adopted its sanctuary policy in 1989 x and has long refuse to xrefer minors in police custody to the federal authorities x although adults accused of felonies have always been referred . Some of these minors were later flown to their home countries at taxpayer expense rather than being turned over to immigration authorities . Mr Newsom learned of those flights last May and ordered them stopped .  Mr Newsom's policy was also a response to a series of embarrassing revelations in The San Francisco Chronicle x including that the city x rather than turning a group of young Honduran crack dealers over to ICE x sent them to a group home in Southern California x from which they walked away .  The city was also shocked by a June 2008 triple murder x which prosecutors say was committed by Edwin Ramos x a suspected gang member and an illegal immigrant from El Salvador who had been picked up as a juvenile by the San Francisco police but not referred to immigration authorities .  The fate of the sanctuary policy may xwell be decided in court .  An August memorandum from the office of the city attorney x Dennis Herrera x to Mr Newsom said that while federal and state law concerning sanctuary cities was ''not settled ,'' the ordinance that passed Tuesday could also ''adversely affect'' the city's position in several pending cases concerning its sanctuary policy x including a criminal investigation by the United States attorney's office in San Francisco .  Mr Ballard x Mr Newsom's spokesman x echoed this x saying the supervisors' vote x which will be formalized at a final reading of the bill next week x could invite a federal legal challenge to the entire sanctuary city policy .  ''The supervisors did a foolish thing today by passing this bill that moves one step closer to imperiling the entire sanctuary city ordinance ,'' Mr Ballard said .  But Mr Campos x the supervisor and a naturalized citizen who emigrated x illegally x from his native Guatemala when he was 14 x said the vote to change Mr Newsom's policy was necessary to maintain the city's reputation as a safe haven for illegal residents .  ''We went from being one of the most enlightened cities ,'' Mr Campos said x ''to be a place many steps backward to where the rest of the country is .'' URL: http://www .nytimescom","Positive",4545

The explosion x which left at least 11 people dead and more than 60 wounded x came just hours before General Jones began meetings with Pakistan's president x Asif Ali Zardari x and its army chief x Gen . Ashfaq Parvez Kayani .  General Jones briefed Mr Zardari and other senior officials on the American strategy for Afghanistan x said a Pakistani official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of diplomatic protocol .  President Obama had ''promised that Pakistan will be taken into confidence on Afghan strategy ,'' the official said x and that General Jones's visit on Friday ''constituted that taking into confidence .''  There was (no) not doubt about the target or the motive of the bombing on Friday: Pakistan's intelligence agency x the Inter Services Intelligence directorate x is a prominent symbol of military power x and militants have struck at it in different cities in Pakistan .  Pakistan's military is conducting a sweeping campaign against the Taliban in Waziristan x a region on the border with Afghanistan . The campaign has led to a sharp increase in reprisals by militants x and Friday's is believed to be yet another in the series .  Peshawar x a bustling city in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province x has been hit particularly hard x with near daily bombings that have unsettled residents and interrupted daily rhythms . Schools in the area of the blast were closed for the day .  ''The underlying idea is to shake the people's confidence in the military's efforts ,'' said Hasan Askari Rizvi x a military analyst in Lahore . ''It's a kind of strategy x well planned x well thought out x to pressure the government through ordinary people .''

Witnesses confirmed hearing gunshots before the blast . ''I heard some firing ,'' a wounded man told a private television station . ''Then there was a flash x and then x boom .''  The building's roof and the compound's boundary walls came down in the explosion . Residents said the explosion could be heard around the city x rattling windows .  Militants have hidden in Pakistan's western tribal areas for years x but have only recently begun to attack the state itself . That shift eventually prompted broad military action x representing a break from the past x when the military and Pakistani society were deeply ambivalent about fighting militants .  Mr Rizvi x the military analyst x said he believed that violence in Pakistan would be reduced over time as the military made more progress in its operation in Waziristan .  He also said that the authorities in Punjab x the country's most populous province x had arrested dozens of local residents suspected of having links to the Taliban . The arrests x Mr Rizvi said x had weakened the militancy in Punjab x where several high profile attacks took place this year x including a brazen assault on the Sri Lankan cricket team .  Mian Iftikhar Hussain x the information minister for the North West Frontier Province x vowed to expand the fight against militants . ''Let the operation not stop at South Waziristan ,'' he said .

The case became a symbol of callous treatment of psychiatric patients after the New York Civil Liberties Union and other lawyers released a security video that showed Ms Green writhing and lying on the floor while workers ignored her .  Last month x the city's Department of Investigation issued a report that could become a template for the xgrand jury investigation . It named three doctors and three nurses or nurse's aides x saying that they were complicit either in the neglect of the patient or in a cover up over a period of four shifts .  Although the medical examiner found that Ms Green had died of a blood clot x ruling out homicide x it is possible that the xgrand jury could consider lesser charges related to her death or to the falsification of hospital records . A spokesman for Mr Hynes decline to xsay what charges might be considered .  The city report said that contrary to protocol x Bernardita Cabildo x the head nurse for the midnight to 8 am shift on June 18 x did not add Ms Green to the ''24 Hour Observation Sheet'' that lists incoming patients .  Dr . Rashed Abedin told investigators x according to the report x that he had made three unsuccessful attempts to examine Ms Green during the next shift x between 8 am and 5 pm . he said she was uncooperative .  But investigators found that Dr . Abedin's account was contradicted by the surveillance video and by written notes .  The city found that two other doctors x Dr . Dimitru Magardician and Dr . David Estes x who ultimately pronounced her dead x made (no) not effort to examine Ms Green during a third shift x and that during the fourth x Ms Green had (no) not contact with any doctors and (little) not contact with nursing staff until she died at 6:35 am  The city found that a senior nurse x Aida Gonzalo x made three false entries in Ms Green's medical records x making it appear that she had been in normal condition 45 minutes before she was discovered on the floor . A nursing aide x Royal Easton x was found to have made false entries indicating that he had checked on Ms Green and found that she was sleeping x when in fact Mr Easton was on a break .  There were so few patients in the waiting room during the night that the two nurses x Ms Gonzalo and Ms Cabildo x were taking a break at the time Ms Green collapsed about 5:30 am x the report said .  Ana Marengo x a spokeswoman for the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation x said the agency would be ''fully supportive'' of the investigation . She said that the three doctors and one nurse x Ms Cabildo x were still working at the hospital .  Calls on Tuesday afternoon to the doctors at the hospital and at their homes were not immediately returned . Ms Cabildo x reached at the hospital x decline to xcomment . Ms Gonzalo did not respond to a message left on her home phone . Mr Easton has been reassigned outside Kings County hospital x and has been recommended for firing pending disciplinary hearings x Ms Marengo said . A woman who answered the phone at his home said he would have (no) not comment .  Sanford Rubenstein x a lawyer for the Green family x said Ms Green's children were pleased that the xgrand jury was investigating . ''The family wants anyone who committed a criminal act to be held accountable and liable criminally ,'' Mr Rubenstein said Tuesday . URL: http://www .nytimescom","Negative",4149
"317",101073,"At a time when we Americans may abandon health xcare reform because it supposedly is ''too xexpensive ,'' how is it that we can afford to imprison people like Curtis Wilkerson .  Mr Wilkerson is serving a life sentence in California x for stealing a $2 .50 pair of socks . As The Economist noted recently x he already had two offenses on his record (both for abetting robbery at age 19) x and so the ''three strikes'' law resulted in a life sentence .  This is unjust x of course . But considering that California spends almost $49 ,000 annually per prison inmate x it's also an extraordinary waste of money .  Astonishingly x many politicians seem to think that we should lead the world in prisons x not health xcare or education . The United States is anomalous among industrialized countries in the high proportion of people we incarcerate . likewise x we stand out in the high proportion of people who have (no) not medical xcare x and partly as a result x our health xcare outcomes such as life expectancy and infant mortality are unusually poor .  It's time for a fundamental re evaluation of the criminal justice system x as legislation sponsored by Senator Jim Webb has called for x so that we are (no) (no longer) not squandering money that would be far better spent on education or health . Consider a few facts:  The United States incarcerates people at nearly five times the world average . Of those sentenced to state prisons x 82 percent were convicted of nonviolent crimes x according to one study .  California spends $216 ,000 annually on each inmate in the juvenile justice system . In contrast x it spends only $8 ,000 on each child attending the troubled Oakland public school system x according to the Urban Strategies Council .  For most of American history x we had incarceration rates similar to those in other countries . Then with the ''war on drugs'' and the focus on law and order in the 1970s x incarceration rates soared .  One in 10 black men ages 25 to 29 were imprisoned last year x partly because possession of crack cocaine (disproportionately used in black communities) draws sentences equivalent to having 100 times as much powder cocaine . Black men in the United States have a 32 percent chance of serving time in prison at some point in their lives x according to the Sentencing Project .  Look x there's (no) not doubt that many people in prison are cold blooded monsters who deserve to be there . But over all x in a time of limited resources x we are overinvesting in prisons and underinvesting in schools .  Indeed x education spending may reduce the need for incarceration . The evidence on this isn't conclusive x but it's noteworthy that graduates of the Perry Preschool program in Michigan x an intensive effort for disadvantaged children in the 1960s x were some 40 percent (less) not likely to be arrested than those in a control group .  Above all x it's time for a rethink of our drug policy . The point is not surrender to narcotics x but to learn from our approach to both tobacco and alcohol . Over time x we have developed public health strategies that have been quite successful in reducing the harm from smoking and drinking .  If we want to try a public health approach to drugs x we could learn from Portugal . In 2001 x it decriminalized the possession of all drugs for personal use . Ordinary drug users can still be required to participate in a treatment program x but they are (no) (no longer) not dispatched to jail .  ''Decriminalization has had (no) not adverse effect on drug usage rates in Portugal ,'' notes a report this year from the Cato Institute . It notes that drug use appears to be lower in Portugal than in most other European countries x and that Portuguese public opinion is strongly behind this approach .  A new United Nations study x World Drug Report 2009 x commends the Portuguese experiment and urges countries to continue to pursue traffickers while largely (avoiding) not imprisoning users . Instead x it suggests that users x particularly addicts x should get treatment .  Senator Webb has introduced legislation that would create a national commission to investigate criminal justice issues x for such a commission may be the best way to depoliticize the issue and give feckless politicians the cover they need to institute changes .  ''There are only two possibilities here ,'' Mr Webb said in introducing his bill x noting that America imprisons so many more people than other countries . ''Either we have the most evil people on earth living in the United States x or we are doing something dramatically wrong in terms of how we approach the issue of criminal justice .''  Opponents of universal health xcare and early childhood education say we can't afford them . Granted x deficits are a real constraint and we can't do everything x and prison reform will not come near to fully financing health xcare reform . Still x would we rather use scarce resources to educate children and heal the sick x or to imprison people because they used drugs or stole a pair of socks .

"319",101140,"The federal government is stepping up enforcement of an important law x the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act x which authorizes the Justice Department to sue prisons x jails x mental institutions x nursing homes and other facilities that violate the constitutional rights of the confined . In New York State x the department has already intervened three times this year to try to improve protect xagainst the state on behalf of thousands of mentally ill adults who are being isolated from the community x in clear violation of sound medical practice and federal law .  In a ''letter ,'' actually a 40 page report x to Westchester County made public this week x the Justice Department detailed abusive conduct by guards at the Westchester County Jail in Valhalla .  The jail came under federal scrutiny in 2000 after a guard kicked a mentally ill man into a coma . The injured man later died x and the guard was convicted and sent to prison . The Justice Department inspected the jail last year x and the new report found that some conditions violate the inmates' constitutional rights .  The investigation relied in part on videotapes that corrections officers made of their encounters with inmates in order to protect themselves from charges of abuse . In this case x federal officials say x the tapes showed them repeatedly injuring or needlessly inflicting pain on inmates . According to investigators x the officers obscured what actually happened by filing inaccurate incident reports . Supervisors who could have uncovered the abuse by viewing the videos seem not so .  In what investigators described as a typical case x officers justified placing a woman in restraints and spraying her with mace by describing her in the incident report as out of control and ''very combative .'' The report says the tape shows an officer driving the woman's head into a wall x while other officers wrestled her to the floor x applying handcuffs and leg restraints . An officer then sprayed her face with mace . The report also cites pronounced deficiencies in medical xcare at the jail . And x as is often the case in jails and prisons x the Westchester facility's care for mentally ill inmates is said to fall far short of constitutional standards .  Westchester will need to make sweeping reforms to bring its jail into compliance with federal law and basic standards of decency .

"320",101169,"The Justice Department's ethics office has recommended reversing the Bush administration and reopening nearly a dozen prisoner abuse cases x potentially exposing Central Intelligence Agency employees and contractors to prosecution for brutal treatment of terrorism suspects x according to a person officially briefed on the matter .  The recommendation by the Office of Professional Responsibility x presented to Attorney General Eric H . Holder Jr . in recent weeks x comes as the Justice Department is about to disclose on Monday voluminous details on prisoner abuse that were gathered in 2004 by the CIA .'s inspector general but have (never) not released .  When the CIA . first referred its inspector general's findings to prosecutors x they decided that (none) not cases merited prosecution . But Mr Holder's associates say that when he took office and saw the allegations x which included the deaths of people in custody and other cases of physical or mental torment x he began to reconsider .  With the release of the details on Monday and the formal advice that at least some cases be reopened x it now seems all but certain that the appointment of a prosecutor or other concrete steps will follow x posing significant new problems for the CIA . It is politically awkwardxtoo x for Mr Holder because President Obama has said that he would rather move forward than get bogged down in the issue at the expense of his own agenda .  The advice from the Office of Professional Responsibility strengthens Mr Holder's hand .  The recommendation to review the closed cases x in effect renewing the inquiries x centers mainly on allegations of detainee abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan . The Justice Department report is to be made public after classified information is deleted from it .  The cases represent about half of those that were initially investigated and referred to the Justice Department by the CIA .'s inspector general x but were later closed . It is not known which cases might be reopened .  Mr Holder was said to have reacted with disgust earlier this year when he first read accounts of abusive treatment of detainees in a classified version of the inspector general's report and other materials .  In examples that have just come to light x the CIA . report describes how CIA . officers carried out mock executions and threatened at least one prisoner with a gun and a power drill . It is a violation of the federal torture statute to threaten a prisoner with imminent death .  Mr Holder x who questioned the thoroughness of previous inquiries by the Justice Department x is expected to announce within days his decision on whether to appoint a prosecutor to conduct a new investigation . in legal circles x it is believed to be highly likely that he will go forward with a fresh criminal inquiry .  Paul Gimigliano x a CIA . spokesman x said Sunday that the Justice Department recommendation to reopen the cases had not sent to the intelligence agency . He added: ''Decisions on whether or not pursue act xlike that of Manadel al Jamadi x who died in 2003 in CIA . custody at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq after he was first captured by a team of Navy Seals . Prosecutors said he probably received his fatal injuries during his capture x but lawyers for the Seals denied it .  Over the years x some Democratic lawmakers sought more details about the cases and why the Justice Department took (no) not action . They received summaries of the number of cases under scrutiny but few facts about the episodes or the department's decisions not prosecute .  The cases do not center on allegations of abuse by CIA . officers who conducted the forceful interrogations of high level Qaeda suspects at secret sites x although it is not out of the question that a new investigation would also examine their conduct .  That could mean a look at the case in which CIA . officers threatened one prisoner with a handgun and a power drill if he did not cooperate . The detainee x Abd al Rahim al Nashiri x was suspected as the master plotter behind the 2000 bombing of the Navy destroyer Cole .  All civilian employees of the government x including those at the CIA . x were required to comply with guidelines for interrogations detailed in a series of legal opinions written by the Justice Department . Those opinions x since abandoned by the Obama administration x were the central focus of the Justice Department's internal inquiry .  It has been known that the Justice Department ethics report had criticized the authors of the legal opinions and x in some cases x would recommend referrals to local bar associations for discipline .  But the internal inquiry also examined how the opinions were carried out and how referrals of possible violations were made x a process that led ethics investigators to find misconduct serious enough to warrant renewed criminal investigation .

"321",101203,"For 37 days x the Salvadoran immigrant was held captive in a crowded room near the border with scores of people x all of them Central Americans who had been kidnapped while heading north x hoping to cross into the United States . He finally got out in August x he said x after the Mexican Army raided the house in the middle of the night to free them .  ''The army said: 'Don't run . We are here to help you ,' '' recalled the migrant x a 30 year old father of three who insisted that his name not printed for fear of either being kidnapped again or deported . ''I kept running .''  Getting to ''el norte'' has (never) not cakewalk . Along with long treks through desert terrain x death defying river crossings and perilous rides clinging onto trains x there have always been con men and crooked police officers preying on migrants along the way .  But Mexican human rights groups that monitor migration say the threats foreigners face as they cross Mexico for the United States have grown significantly in recent months . Organized crime groups have begun taking aim at migrants as major sources of illicit revenue x even as the financial crisis in the United States has reduced the number of people willing to risk the journey .  Kidnapping people for ransom is a pervasive problem in this country x although victims have typically been prosperous people with bank accounts that can be emptied at the nearest ATM . x or those with relatives willing to hand over significant sums to save them .  Migrants may typically be poor x often with (little) not pockets except the scrawled telephone numbers of relatives who have migrated before them x but they have usually notified friends or relatives in the United States that they are on their way . To kidnappers x those contacts are golden . ''They beat me and kept beating me until I handed over my telephone numbers ,'' said the Salvadoran immigrant x interviewed at a center for migrants in Reynosa x just across the border with Texas .  In many ways x the man's account was typical . A study by Mexico's National Human Rights Commission released this year found 9 ,758 migrants who had been kidnapped as they tried to cross the border into the United States between September 2008 and February 2009 . The commission noted that migrants were typically terrified to report such crimes out of fear of being deported by Mexican immigration authorities and that the actual number of victims was probably much higher .  The stories the commission heard in interviews with victims were alarming . There were frequent rapes of female migrants . Fierce beatings were carried out . As a lesson to other captives x the kidnappers killed some migrants who did not hand over the telephone numbers of their relatives .  ''They said that if they did not receive payment x they would take away my kidney afterward and throw me into the river so the big lizards would eat me ,'' a Honduran man who was kidnapped in Tabasco State told commission investigators .  He said he had been kidnapped along with 60 or so others x all Central Americans . The men who took them said they were coyotes x or human smugglers x and promised to feed them and help them cross into the United States . Instead x the men forced the captives over 30 days to call relatives in the United States and extract thousands of dollars from them in order to be released .  The amounts demanded ranged from $1 ,500 to $10 ,000 x sizable sums on top of the several thousand dollars that the migrants had already paid smugglers to make the crossing .  One victim x a Honduran man kidnapped in Nuevo Laredo at the Texas border x told investigators that he was close xopportunityy of higher wages in the United States and return home .  ''There was danger of robbery back then ,'' he said of his first crossing 10 years ago . ''It's always been dangerous . But now it's gotten even worse . We are poor and we are trying to get ahead .

The court rightly recognized that cellphones today are a lot more than just telephones x that they hold a wealth of personal information and that the privacy interest in them is considerable . This was the first such ruling from a state supreme court . It is a model for other courts to follow .  Searches generally require warrants x but courts have carved out limited categories in which they are not needed .

But because Mr Kaine did not grant a full pardon x they will continue to be stigmatized .  Derek E . Tice x Joseph J . Dick Jr . x Danial J . Williams and Eric C . Wilson were convicted in the 1997 rape and murder of Michelle Moore Bosko in Norfolk . It was a horrific crime x but it seems clear that it was committed by someone else . Omar Ballard x who knew the victim x has confessed . His DNA . matched evidence from the crime scene x and he has said that he acted alone .  The case against the four sailors x (none) not had prior criminal records x was based almost entirely on their confessions x which followed high pressure interrogations . Legal experts say that false confessions are surprisingly common x especially when suspects are harshly questioned and x as in this case x threatened with the death penalty if they do not confess .  One of the four x Mr Wilson x who was not convicted of murder x served his sentence and was released in 2005 . The three others were given life sentences . Governor Kaine declared that they had raised ''substantial doubts'' about their convictions and the justification for continuing to imprison them . He reduced their sentences to time served . But he denied all four the absolute pardons they sought x saying they had not ''conclusively established'' their innocence .  At a time when politicians do everything they can to show they are tough on crime x Mr Kaine deserves credit for releasing them . But (without) not cleared x these men are likely to have considerable trouble returning to normal lives . They could have trouble finding jobs . And they may spend years on parole x the requirements of which are often so elaborate that even wellxmeaning parolees end up in violation and back in jail . They will also be subject to sex offender registration requirements .  The men should note up . They may still be able to persuade a court to overturn their convictions x or Governor Kaine to grant a full pardon . The miscarriage of justice in this case has been diminished x but not wiped away . URL: http://www .nytimescom","Negative",2358

Applications to the Police Academy rose 54 percent in 2008 from 2007 x when there were 17 ,212 applicants . The wider pool of candidates has enabled the department to become more diverse by the year . the percentage of black x Hispanic and Asian officers has steadily risen since 2000 x as has the percentage of female officers .  The department is also better educated than in the past: in 1999 x 17 percent of the force had four year college degrees . this year x the figure rose to 24 percent .

Over the next year x the department will continue to shrink through attrition to 34 ,304 members x about 6 ,000 fewer than in 2001 .  ''When we had the money x we didn't have the people ,'' the police commissioner x Raymond W . Kelly x said in an interview . ''Now we have the people and we don't have the money .

In interviews x rookie officers said that two economic factors x the poor xorganizedations were not able to xkeep them interested x and there was resentment from others of their degrees .''  Dr . Henry said x however x that the economy and the increased interest in the force presented the department with ''a tremendous opportunity'' to attract officers with significant life experiences .  For Officer Gerard Salvia x the Police Department provided an opportunity to break away from what he said was the hierarchical nature of Wall Street x where x he said x he thought he would not advance .

But on Tuesday x the political mood seemed to shift .  Marc Laffineur x the xvice president of the French Assembly and a member of President Nicolas Sarkozy's ruling center right party x the Union for a Popular Movement x took issue with the French culture and foreign ministers' remarks xsupport either that his crime does not qualify for extradition x because he was originally to have been sentenced to (less) not year in prison x or that he has already effectively served his sentence x during a 42 day psychiatric evaluation .

By Tuesday x though x the mood was shifting .

Marie Louise Fort x an Assembly member who has sponsored (anti) not incest legislation x said in an interview that she was shocked by the support for Mr Polanski .  ''I don't believe that public opinion is spontaneously supporting Mr Polanski at all ,'' Ms Fort said . ''I believe that there is a distinction between the mediagenic class of artists and ordinary citizens that have a vision that is more simple .''  The mood was more hostile in blogs and e mail to newspapers and news magazines . An online question in the French daily Le Figaro showed that more than 70 percent of about 30 ,000 respondents said Mr Polanski should face justice .

"336",101793,"The United States government has spent only 2 percent of the more than $1 billion it has pledged to help Mexico win its battle against drug traffickers x according to a government study released Thursday .  Despite vows by the Bush administration x and now the Obama administration x to help President Felipe Calderon of Mexico in his three year long assault against drug cartels x actual spending totaled only about $24 million by the end of September x the Government Accountability Office said .  Two years ago x the United States announced a $1dot4 billion x multiyear aid package for Mexico and Central America x a huge increase over previous spending x but the delivery of the money has been bogged down by burdensome contracting rules and other delays x the agency found .  The slow disbursement of funds has frustrated top Mexican officials x with Mr Calderon raising the issue in a meeting with American lawmakers this year .  Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton x questioned about the slow spending when she visited Mexico City in July x acknowledged that ''our long process of approval was cumbersome and challenging for the Mexican government'' and vowed to ''see what we can do to cut that time .''  Mexico and the United States first agreed to increase American antidrug aid during meetings in March 2007 between President George W . Bush and Mr Calderon in the city of Merida . The so called Merida Initiative resulting from the meeting represented the largest foreign aid package in the Western Hemisphere since Plan Colombia x a multibillion dollar effort initiated in 2000 to combat drug cartels and end the insurgency in that country .  The hundreds of millions of dollars in annual aid pledged for Mexico represents a xsignificant increase over previous spending . In 2007 x for instance x Mexico received only $36 .7 million in counternarcotics assistance . Central American nations have also been promised more money in antidrug aid x and spending in the region has been similarly behind expectations .  The State Department attributed some of the delay to the challenge of tracking all the money and programs spread across numerous government agencies x saying that dozens of additional staff members have had to be hired at the American Embassy in Mexico to handle administrative matters .  Helicopters and a surveillance plane are the most expensive items x and contracting requirements associated with such aircraft have slowed the spending x officials said . It usually takes two years from the beginning of contract negotiations for helicopters to be delivered x State Department officials said . In Mexico's case x the time lapse will be much shorter if five Bell helicopters are delivered as scheduled . But delivery of a surveillance plane and Black Hawk helicopters for the Mexican military will take longer . URL: http://www .nytimescom","Negative",2875

As a result x disease prevention programs had to be cut x and ''if you don't give funding to Al Shabab areas x that's 60 percent of the people ,'' she added .  American officials defend xagainst Somalia's transitional government . While the transitional government struggles to establish itself x United Nations officials say they have (no) not choice but to work with local Shabab commanders to distribute critically needed aid in Shabab controlled areas .  Preliminary information from a continuing United Nations investigation indicates that some of the biggest Somali contractors hired by the United Nations World Food Program may be sharing their proceeds with the Shabab or their allies x or x at a minimum x turning a blind eye when militants steal sacks of American donated grain and sell them on the xopen market to get money for guns .  Peter Smerdon x a spokesman for the World Food Program in Kenya x said the agency was conducting its own separate investigation and ''taking immediate actions to increase security at WFP . warehouses and other distribution points .''  Because Somalia is so dangerous x especially for foreigners x it is difficult for international aid agencies to closely monitor operations in the country .

"348",102199,"The Denver shuttle bus driver at the center of a federal terrorism investigation has begun to cooperate with the authorities x admitting that he had perhaps unwittingly crossed paths in Pakistan with extremists allied with Al Qaeda x according to government officials briefed on the case .  The officials did not indicate whether the admissions of the man x Najibullah Zazi x made during three days of intense questioning by FBI . agents in Denver x clarified whether he had directly engaged in terrorist activity . And it is not known whether his account could mean he will be charged with any wrongdoing .  But Mr Zazi's discussions with the authorities did seem to shed light on the suspicions that led federal and New York counterterrorism officials to begin intensive inquiries and to raid apartments in a suburb of Denver and in Queens x New York x believing he was the central figure in some kind of nascent x if still murky x terrorist activity .  Mr Zazi's statements to government officials suggest a somewhat different narrative than the one he presented in interviews with reporters this week when he denied being affiliated with Al Qaeda and said he had (no) not idea why the government would suspect him of wrongdoing . Indeed x there are now some indications that Mr Zazi underwent training in explosives and bomb making while overseas .  Government officials said that the interviews with Mr Zazi were providing federal agents with a volume of new information and the possibility that Mr Zazi's statements might lead to an arrest in a case that has so far been highlighted by aggressive searches unaccompanied by the filing of any charges .  The officials said prosecutors might reach some kind of an agreement with Mr Zazi in exchange for his cooperation x but said such a step would probably not occur until after investigators have time to examine his statements x sift through evidence seized in recent days and determine whether other people may also be involved .  The investigation focusing on Mr Zazi came to light on Monday after a weekend of hurried activity by federal and local authorities focused on Mr Zazi's Sept 10 trip to New York . The authorities raided four residences connected to him in Queens and executed search warrants at his home in Aurora x Colo . x and the home of his relatives there . Mr Zazi's lawyers have repeatedly asked why (no) not arrests have been made x in asserting that their client is not involved in terrorism .  Media reports surfaced on Friday that Mr Zazi's lawyers were negotiating a plea deal for him to admit having had military training x presumably meaning that he had attended terrorist training camps . But Wendy S . Aiello x a spokeswoman for Mr Zazi's lawyer x Arthur Folsom x called them ''unfounded .'' Later x however x she decline to xrule out the possibility that a plea arrangement was being negotiated in exchange for leniency toward Mr Zazi .  Ms Aiello said Mr Zazi and his lawyer x Mr Folsom x left the FBI . offices in Denver on Friday night and were expected to return for a fourth day of questioning on Saturday . She said there were (no) not plea negotiations .  By midday x federal agents were asking to meet also with his father x Mohammed Zazi x 53 . Ms Aiello said the elder Mr Zazi voluntarily went in for FBI . questioning and left later .  ''Najibullah and his family continue to cooperate fully with the FBI . ,'' Ms Aiello said .  So far x (neither) not New York (nor) not federal officials have publicly explained their interest in Mr Zazi . Among the unanswered questions is precisely what information persuaded the authorities that Mr Zazi might represent a threat and led them to open an inquiry in Colorado and New York .  The officials said there were several factors x including his trips to Pakistan x which he and his lawyers have said in interviews earlier this week were made only to visit his wife and family members in Peshawar .  He first came to the attention of American intelligence months ago when he was in contact with Al Qaeda operatives in Pakistan who are believed to play a xsignificant role in trying to encourage attacks against American and other Western targets x the officials indicated .  An American adviser to United States intelligence agencies who has been briefed on some details of the inquiry said that investigators were focusing in part on Mr Zazi's activities in Peshawar x where he met and married his wife . Peshawar is the capital of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province and a gateway to the tribal areas where the Taliban and Al Qaeda have made a base .  ''He was there getting training in explosives and bomb making ,'' the adviser x who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the continuing investigation x said he had been told .  The authorities x throughout x have signaled their interest in other people besides Mr Zazi . Several men were questioned x at length x as the raids of homes in Queens occurred over several hours Sunday night and early Monday . It was unclear x however x if the authorities who have remained outside those homes for days had taken more men away for additional questioning on Thursday and Friday .

"353",102379," ABOVE the shimmering horizon x in the middle of a deserted highway x stands an oversize figure wearing a golf cap x huge sunglasses x baggy jeans x and an iPhone on his hip x not your typical outfit in war torn Somalia . But then again x Mohamed Aden x the man waiting in the road x is not your typical Somali . The instant his guests arrive x he spreads his arms wide x ready for a bear hug .  ''Welcome to Adado ,'' he says x beaming . ''Now x let us bounce .''  Mr Aden x 37 x is part militia commander x part schoolteacher x part lawmaker x part engineer x part environmentalist x part king x a mind boggling combination of roles for anyone to play x let alone for a guy who dresses (and talks) xlike a rapper and recently moved from Minnesota to Somalia in an effort to build a local government .  Think of him as the accidental warlord . And a shard of hope . In (less) not year x Mr Aden x who was born in Somalia and emigrated to the United States at age 22 x has essentially built a state within a state .  With money channeled from fellow clansmen living in the United States and Europe x he has transformed Adado and its surroundings in central Somalia x which used to be haunted by bandits and warring Islamic factions x into an enclave of peace x with a functioning police force x scores of new businesses x new schools and new rules .  Somalia is one of the most violent countries on the planet x and at times Mr Aden has had to speak with the business end of a machine gun . His patch x which encompasses around 5 ,000 square miles and a few hundred thousand people x most of them desperately poor nomads and members of his own Saleban clan x is now one of the safest parts of this broken nation .  Even outsiders are noticing .  ''When I landed here x I was taken aback x in a good way ,'' said Denise Brown x a United NationsWorld Food Program official who visited Adado in March . ''I didn't see what I usually see in Somalia: destitution x chaos x needy people .''  Mr Aden does not back an intense insurgency in the capital x Mogadishu .  Most of what Mr Aden has accomplished he has accomplished on his own x in distinctly Somali fashion . His police officers carry rocket propelled grenades . Parked in front of the police station are two enormous tanks .  ''My Cadillacs ,'' Mr Aden calls them .  But however playful or flamboyant he may come across x Mr Aden seems to have hit upon a deeper truth . People want government x he says x even in Somalia . ''They are begging for it ,'' he said .  His experiment of building a small local government from the bottom up x relying on that one feature of Somali society that has bedeviled just about all national governance efforts to date x the clan x may have wider implications for the rest of the country x which seems to export trouble continuously x most recently in the form of pirates . Many pirates are act xlike mirrors scattered across the desert .  Mr Aden grew up in Mogadishu x the son of a military mechanic x the firstborn of 10 . He fled Somalia with an uncle in 1992 x a year after the central government collapsed and his friends split into rival militias . ''I didn't see myself in this war ,'' he said .  But the war saw him . He was xshot to Miami x where he lived in a homeless shelter . He eventually took a Greyhound bus to Minneapolis x the promised land for Somali immigrants and home to the largest Somali community in the United States . There he put himself through college parking cars and working in a factory x always keeping abreast of politics back home x hoping to jump in one day . Yet when finally presented with the opportunity x he turned down the Adado elders twice before relenting .  ''It was hard for my wife and kids ,'' he said . ''But I am doing something big here x and they know that .''  HE spends his days in a large house in the center of town x where he has rigged up a small command center with a laptop x his iPhone and an Internet connection . As chairman of Himan and Heeb Administration x the province where Adado is located x he often meets with elders on his living room carpet x and he has had to straddle a delicate religious line x respecting the conservative Muslim culture here (without) not coming across as phony . This spring x central Somalia was hit again by a devastating drought x and the elders asked him to lead a rain prayer . ''I am not (no) not imam ,'' he grumbled at first x though he eventually agreed to do it .  Mr Aden seems to be a naturally upbeat person x but the one thing that drags him down is the drought . During a drive across the skinned landscape of his area a few months ago x he came upon a young man lying under a lean to of sticks and blankets . The man was in bad shape x very thin x sweaty and empty eyed . People said he had typhoid . And tuberculosis . And malaria .  Mr Aden looked down at him and said he would pray .

"355",102389,"For 30 years x Eli M . Rosenbaum has been hunting Nazi war criminals . Even as the last of them die off x he is noting up .  ''There is still time to bring some of these people to justice x and we ought not fail to xdo that ,'' said Mr Rosenbaum x director of the Office of Special Investigations x who arrived at that Justice Department agency as a summer intern in 1979 x the year it was created x and became its chief in 1995 .  Though the agency once pursued war criminals of the Nazis and their Axis allies exclusively x a 2004 law expanded its role to cover modern war criminals x in places like Bosnia and Rwanda . The office's task is to detect war crimes suspects living in the United States x prosecute them under immigration law x seeking to denaturalize those who have obtained citizenship x and deport them x preferably to countries where they can be tried for the crimes alleged .  Mr Rosenbaum says that at present x about 30 people in the United States who may have a Nazi past are under investigation x along with some 80 possible war criminals from more recent conflicts .  About half the office's recent litigation efforts have involved Nazi suspects x among them John Demjanjuk x who is charged with atrocities as a concentration camp guard in Poland . Mr Demjanjuk was deported to Germany in May .  ''It's a few years more ,'' Mr Rosenbaum said of the hunt for the last Nazis . ''I don't think that you will hear the department soon say: 'That's it . These cases are finished .' ''  But the inevitable dwindling of the population of Nazi suspects has meant changes for the Office of Special Investigations . Among other things x the office historians who once researched only World War II have become experts on modern war crimes .  Rabbi Marvin Hier x founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center x lauded the expansion of the office's duties x saying prompt pursuit of war criminals was essential .  ''I think it's very important x because we all know that evil didn't end with the Nazi Holocaust ,'' Rabbi Hier said . ''The greatest tragedy is that the OSI . was not formed in 1945'' but instead more than three decades later .  Investigating modern war crimes has required a new approach . While World War II cases are often based on documents collected by the office historians x modern cases rely on the testimony of witnesses .  Mr Rosenbaum finds these cases particularly affecting .  ''I had met many people who had done heroic things during World War II ,'' he said . ''But I had (never) not experience of meeting people who were doing heroic things x risking their lives x at the time that we were meeting x people who took some risks just in meeting with us .''  Mr Rosenbaum recently met with Gladys Monterroso x the wife of Guatemala's human rights ombudsman x Sergio Morales . Ms Monterroso was tortured during a brief abduction in March x a day after her husband issued a report on human rights abuses that occurred in Guatemala's 35 year civil war x which ended in 1996 .  ''It's one of those meetings that changes you forever ,'' Mr Rosenbaum said . ''You could see the cigarette burns on her arm and legs . You could see where the rope had been tied to her arms and ankles . We (never) not experience that in the World War II cases .''  Despite dozens of investigations x the office has undertaken only a handful of prosecutions in the last few years . But Mr Rosenbaum sees significance in demonstrating that the agency will investigate war crimes suspects even if those investigations do not lead to convictions .  ''I think there's particular value ,'' he said x ''in showing would be perpetrators that if one dares to perpetrate such crimes x there is a chance that he or she will be pursued for the rest of his or her life to locations thousands of miles from the locations of their crimes .''

"356",300005,"All it took was an early thaw for the drinking water here to become unsafe .  There are 41 ,000 dairy cows in Brown County x which includes Morrison x and they produce more than 260 million gallons of manure each year x much of which is spread on nearby grain fields . Other farmers receive fees to cover their land with slaughterhouse waste and treated sewage .  In measured amounts x that waste acts as fertilizer . But if the amounts are excessive x bacteria and chemicals can flow into the ground and contaminate residents' tap water .  In Morrison x more than 100 wells were polluted by agricultural runoff within a few months x according to local officials . As parasites and bacteria seeped into drinking water x residents suffered from chronic diarrhea x stomach illnesses and severe ear infections .  ''Sometimes it smells xlike a barn coming out of the faucet ,'' said Lisa Barnard x who lives a few towns over x and just 15 miles from the city of Green Bay .  Tests of her water showed it contained E . coli x coliform bacteria and other contaminants found in manure . Last year x her 5 year old son developed ear infections that eventually required an operation . Her doctor told her they were most likely caused by bathing in polluted water x she said .  Yet runoff from all but the largest farms is essentially unregulated by many of the federal laws intended to prevent pollution and protect drinking water sources . The Clean Water Act of 1972 largely regulates only chemicals or contaminants that move through pipes or ditches x which means it does not typically apply to waste that is sprayed on a field and seeps into groundwater .  As a result x many of the agricultural pollutants that contaminate drinking water sources are often subject only to state or county regulations . And those laws have fail to xprotect some residents living nearby .  To address this problem x the federal Environmental Protection Agency has created xspecial force people to stop ,'' he added .  In Brown County x part of one of the nation's largest milk producing regions x agriculture brings in $3 billion a year . But the dairies collectively also create as much as a million gallons of waste each day . Many cows are fed a high protein diet x which creates a more liquid manure that is easier to spray on fields .  In 2006 x an unusually early thaw in Brown County melted frozen fields x including some that were covered in manure . Within days x according to a county study x more than 100 wells were contaminated with coliform bacteria x E . coli x or nitrates x byproducts of manure or other fertilizers .  ''Land application requirements in place at that time were not sufficiently designed or monitored to prevent the pollution of wells ,'' one official wrote .  Some residents did not realize that their water was contaminated until their neighbors fell ill x which prompted them to test their own water .  ''We were terrified ,'' said Aleisha Petri x whose water was polluted for months x until her husband dumped enough bleach in the xwell to kill the contaminants . Neighbors spent thousands of dollars digging new wells .  At a town hall meeting x angry homeowners yelled at dairy owners x some of whom are perceived as among the most wealthy and powerful people in town .  One resident said that he had seen cow organs dumped on a neighboring field x and his dog had dug up animal carcasses and bones .  ''More than 30 percent of the wells in one town alone violated basic health standards ,'' said Mr Hafs x the Brown County regulator xresponsib for land and water conservation x in an interview . ''It's obvious we have got a problem .''  But dairy owners said it was unfair to blame them for the county's water problems . They noted that state regulators x in their reports x were unable to xdefinitively establish the source of the 2006 contamination .  One of those farmers x Dan Natzke x owns Wayside Dairy x one of the largest farms around here . Just a few decades ago x it had just 60 cows . Today x its 1 ,400 animals live in enormous barns and are milked by suction pumps .  In June x Mr Natzke explained to visiting kindergarteners that his cows produced 1dot5 million gallons of manure a month . The dairy owns 1 ,000 acres and rents another 1 ,800 acres to dispose of that waste and grow crops to feed the cows .  ''Where does the poop go .'' one boy asked . ''And what happens to the cow when it gets old .''  ''The waste helps grow food ,'' Mr Natzke replied . ''And that's what the cow becomesxtoo .''  His farm abides by dozens of state laws x Mr Natzke said .  ''All of our xwaste management is reviewed by our agronomist and by the state's regulators ,'' he added . ''We follow all the rules .''  But records show that his farm was fined $56 ,000 last October for spreading excessive waste . Mr Natzke decline to xcomment .  Many environmental advocates argue that agricultural pollution will be reduced only through stronger federal laws . Lisa P . Jackson x the EPA . administrator x has recently ordered an increase in enforcement of the Clean Water Act . Tom Vilsack x the agriculture secretary x has said that clean water is a priority x and President Obama promised in campaign speeches to regulate water pollution from livestock .  But Congress has not created many new rules on the topic and x as a result x officials say their powers remain limited .  Part of the problem x according to data collected from the EPA . and every state x is that environmental agencies are already overtaxed . And it is unclear how to design effective laws x say regulators x including Ms Jackson x who was confirmed to head the EPA . in January .  To fix the problem of agricultural runoff x ''I don't think there's a solution in my head yet that I could say x right now x write this piece of legislation x this will get it done ,'' Ms Jackson said in an interview .  She added that ''the challenge now is for EPA . and Congress to develop solutions that represent the next step in protecting our nation's waters and people's health .''  A potential solution x regulators say x is to find new uses for manure . In Wisconsin x Gov . Jim Doyle has financed projects to use farm waste to generate electricity .  But environmentalists and some lawmakers say real change will occur only when Congress passes laws giving the EPA . broad powers to regulate farms . Tougher statutes should permit drastic steps x like shutting down farms or blocking expansion x when watersheds become threatened x they argue .  However x a powerful farm lobby has blocked previous environmental efforts on Capital Hill . Even when state legislatures have acted x they have often encountered unexpected difficulties .  After Brown County's wells became polluted x for instance x Wisconsin created new rules prohibiting farmers in many areas from spraying manure during winter x and creating additional requirements for large dairies .  But agriculture is among the state's most powerful industries . After intense lobbying x the farmers' association won a provision requiring the state often to finance up to 70 percent of the cost of following the new regulations . Unless regulators pay x some farmers do not statement x Adam Collins x a spokesman for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources x said farmers can only apply waste to fields ''according to a nutrient management plan x which x among other things x requires that manure runoff be minimized .''  When there is evidence that a farm has ''contaminated a water source x we can and do take enforcement action ,'' he wrote .  ''Wisconsin has a long history of continuously working to improve water xquality and a strong reputation nationally for our clean water efforts ,'' he added . ''Approximately 800 ,000 private drinking water wells serve rural Wisconsin residents . The vast majority of wells provide safe drinking water .''  But anger in some towns remains . At the elementary school a few miles from Mr Natzke's dairy x there are signs above drinking fountains warning that the water may be dangerous for infants .  ''I go to church with the Natzkes ,'' said Joel Reetz x who spent $16 ,000 digging a deeper xwell after he learned his water was polluted . ''Our kid goes to school with their kids . It puts us in a terrible position x because everyone knows each other .  ''But what's happening to this town isn't right ,'' he said .

"359",300011,"Chevron said it had filed an international arbitration claim against Ecuador x opening a new front in its defend xagainst a $27 billion environmental damage lawsuit in Ecuadorean court .  Chevron has often complained of government interference in the 16 year old case x in which indigenous communities have accused Texaco x bought by Chevron in 2001 x of damaging the environment and their health while operating petroleum facilities in the region .  Three weeks ago x Chevron accused the judge in the case of being involved in a $3 million bribery scheme and offered secretly videotaped footage as evidence that led to an Ecuadorean investigation .  Claiming Ecuador's government has violated a bilateral investment treaty between the United States and Ecuador x Chevron said on Wednesday that an arbitration proceeding had commenced before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague under United Nations trade law .  ''Because Ecuador's judicial system is incapable of functioning independently of political influence x Chevron has (no) not choice but to seek relief under the treaty ,'' Hewitt Pate x Chevron's recently appointed general counsel x said in a company statement .  Chevron says that in 1998 x Ecuador and its state oil company x Petroecuador x released Texaco from further liability after Texaco's remediation work was completed .  But plaintiffs in the case argue that the release did not deal with private claims against the company .  According to Chevron's filing x the arbitration process will involve three arbitrators . Chevron has appointed Horacio Grigera Naon x from the college of law at American University x Washington x and a Chevron spokesman x Kent Robertson x said Ecuador would appoint a second who would work with Mr Grigera Naon to appoint a third .  The plaintiffs say Texaco dumped billions of gallons of polluted water in the jungle around where they live for more than two decades before leaving Ecuador in the early 1990s . The first legal action in the case was filed in New York in 1993 x but the case was moved to Ecuador earlier this decade .  An expert appointed by the Ecuadorean court said last year that Chevron should pay around $27 billion x including more than $8 billion in unjust enrichment .  Steven Donziger x an American legal adviser to the plaintiffs x said the latest move by Chevron followed a series of setbacks in courts for the company in both countries .  ''Filing an international arbitration campaign at this point in time smacks of desperation and is a clear example of forum shopping ,'' Mr Donziger said in e mailed statement .  As for the Ecuador case x Judge Juan Nunez sought to remove himself from it to allow for an investigation into Chevron's claims against him x but Mr Donziger said it had not allowed .  ''The judge's request for recusal has been denied ,'' Mr Donziger told Reuters . ''Our interest is not who the judge is . Our interest is that the process be fair .''

That was Philadelphia Eagles Coach Andy Reid after his team signed the quarterback and Michael Vick to a one year contract with an option for a second year on Thursday . Reid x of course x was speaking in favor of the move and went on to say that the 29 year old Vick x who finished a 23 month sentence last month for his role in a dogfighting ring x deserves ''a chance to prove he's doing the right things .''  (Vick spoke on Friday at 11 am at a news conference in Philadelphia .)  News of Vick's signing came during the second quarter of Thursday night's Eagles Patriots exhibition game x in what The Philadelphia Daily News called ''a shocker .'' that even seemed to catch some team officials unaware . For a full roundup of reaction around the league and elsewhere x check out the Fifth Down blog .  Not surprisingly x People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is not keen as Reid on seeing Vick back in the NFL . On The PETA Files blog on Friday was a reminder of what Vick did to his dogs x including electrocution x hanging from trees and worse x coupled with the group's hope that ''Vick has learned his lesson and feel xlike those from the Chargers' Shawne Merriman (''CONGRADS to him'') and the Saints' Reggie Bush (''I think it's great the Mike Vick has signed with the Eagles .

"361",300013," Wayne Pacelle was not here Thursday night for the Eagles debut of Michael Vick x his controversial pitchman in the battle against dogfighting .  Pacelle x the president and chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States x stayed in Washington x where the group is based x while Vick played in his first game xagainst dogfighting outweighed the fallout .  ''I do not believe he is ever going to get back into dogfighting ,'' Pacelle said . ''I am absolutely convinced of that . Do I believe that he cares about animals and wants to see dogfighting end . Yes x I do believe he wants to see dogfighting end . In terms of the depth of his passion x I am not mind reader x but I believe he's going to say the right things to kids and that he's going to stick with the program .''  Vick has been saying the right things x and on Thursday he appeared to speak from the heart x not script . Vick met the news media after the game . For the first time x and that includes his initial news conference and an interview on ''60 Minutes ,'' he seemed completely relaxed x candid x reflective x introspective and even joyful .  He had spent the day traveling between Philadelphia and Newport News x Va . x where a federal bankruptcy judge approved a plan for Vick to repay creditors x who are owed $20 million x provided he enlists the services of a financial adviser .  He entered the game Thursday on the second play x and for the first time in a long time x he saw the bright lights and heard the roar of the crowd . ''It was a great day for me over all ,'' Vick said x adding: ''I can't explain the feeling . It was unbelievable the way that I was embraced and the warm welcome I received . It actually made me screw up one of my reads .''  Vick talked about going off the script on a play that called for him to pass to a running back . Instead x he took off and ran . ''It was just the excitement and being out there ,'' he said . ''After a while x I just told myself to calm down and the big plays will come .''  Vick shouldn't judge acceptance from the response he received from Eagles fans inside the stadium . There x he is preaching to the choir x one desperate for its first championship since 1960 . The positive response inside Lincoln Financial Field was offset by (anti) not Vick demonstrations outside it x a sobering reminder that not everyone is happy with Vick or the Eagles .  Peter Bentivegna was part of what he called ''an organic x independent citizen run demonstration'' to bring public attention to the issue of animal cruelty .  ''In an ideal world x this would help reduce the number of animals that are murdered at shelters every day ,'' Bentivegna said . ''We are hoping to take the publicity that's surrounding the signing of Michael Vick and get people to be aware of the plight of these animals and help either rescue x foster or adopt .''  Bentivegna says he wants to use Vick at a local level x the way the Humane Society is using him nationally to call attention to a dimension of the animal welfare problem . The relationship between Vick and the Humane Society is part of a wellxmanicured initiative that benefits Vick as xwell as the organization . Vick uses the Humane Society for validation . The society plans to use Vick to discuss the evils of dogfighting and animal cruelty with young adults in urban areas .  Thursday's protest x while tame x reflected a polarization concerning animal rights and Vick that exists in Philadelphia and probably in every city the Eagles will visit this season .  A cluster of animal rights demonstrators x who were predominantly white x were in one area outside the stadium x while a predominantly African American group of Vick supporters were in another area .  ''I think it's fascinating that it seems to have fallen out along racial lines ,'' Bentivegna said . ''It seems just from listening to talk radio and hearing comments on the street x it does seem to be that most of the African American people are supportive of Michael Vick having a second chance and playing NFL . quarterback x and most of the people who are supportive of the animals are white people .  ''That to me is fascinating x but I don't think from our standpoint it has any intended issue of race .''  Pacelle said he noted the same racial divide nationally . ''I am simply saying I have noted that the black community has been more embracing of Mike than the white community ,'' he said . ''There seems to be a stronger xstrain of redemption and providing second chances in the African American community maybe than in the white community .''  In an interview Friday morning x Pacelle said he didn't really care how Philadelphia fans reacted to Vick . ''We haven't been boosters or PR people for Vick ,'' he said . ''We are giving him an opportunity to fulfill his pledge to combat dogfighting .''  Vick will be a lightning rod for a number of intriguing issues . But ultimately x the central theme x the only theme x for Vick x more than anything he does on the field x must be (anti) not dogfighting . Effectively hammering home the gospel of animal rights and animal welfare will be Vick's ticket to redemption . URL: http://www .nytimescom","Positive",5196

But for New Jersey caterers who specialize in clambakes x the process is both more prosaic and more practical: galvanized steel tubs resting on a propane stove get the job done . ''Every once in a while we will get a request from somebody for the type of old New England clambake where you dig a huge hole on the beach and are on site cooking for eight hours ,'' said Patty Sisselman x the owner with her husband x Bill x of Shore Catering in Brick Township .

"367",300111,"New York City housing officials and the real estate company that plans to transform the West Side railyards into a high rise residential and business district have agreed to preserve hundreds of apartments near the site as affordable dwellings for low and middle income New Yorkers .  The agreement calls for 551 apartments that are owned by the developer x the Related Companies x or will be acquired by the city x in the area surrounding the 26 acre railyards to remain at those affordable rents x many of them permanently . Rent protections at other development projects often expire .  Related and the city had already pledged to build 743 new below market rate apartments as part of the project x 431 out of roughly 5 ,000 residential units that Related plans at the railyards complex and 312 more to be developed by the city nearby .  Many of the units are intended for families earning (no) not 80 percent of the median household income in the city x roughly $61 ,000 for a four person household under federal guidelines . The agreement x part of a rezoning plan x came about after negotiations between Related and the mayor's office x city housing officials x community activists and City Council leaders x including the Council speaker x Christine C . Quinn x who had made the creation of housing for low and middle income families a priority .  Development plans at the railyards have had a long x rocky history . In 2005 x Mayor Michael R .

''This is a very significant victory for the West Side x to see a plan move forward for the western railyards x a plan that does not include football x and a plan that does include affordable housing ,'' Ms Quinn said at a news conference Monday at City Hall after the rezoning was approved by the Council's zoning subcommittee and its land use committee .  The city expanded its commitment to preserve affordable housing units in the area as a way to achieve the mayor's overall goals of redeveloping the West Side and financing 165 ,000 units of affordable housing throughout the five boroughs . It had the effect of ensuring that the rezoning received broad support from elected officials and community leaders .  ''This isn't just a specific project ,'' said the deputy mayor for economic development x Robert C . Lieber . ''It's really about building out an overall community .''  The relatively smooth approval of the plan by the two Council committees was in stark contrast to another closely watched Related project that the committees took up Monday and ultimately struck down: the redevelopment of the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx into a shopping mall . The rezoning plan for the railyards now heads to the City Planning Commission and then goes before the full Council for final approval next week .  ''We were happy to be able to come up with a menu of affordable options that worked from everybody's point of view ,'' said Jay Cross x president of Related Hudson Yards x the joint venture between Related and Goldman Sachs x that is developing the site .

"372",300138,"IN a car x you would cover the hundred miles of the southern third of the Oregon coast in a couple of hours x and you would think x How gorgeous . But on a bike x you don't so much view the scenery as absorb it . With every xsense and muscle x you register how the hills fold and join x how the air and the light change with distance from the sea . You notice the seed heads ripening beside the road and hear the birds cheering you on your way .  In a car x scenery is wallpaper . On a bike x it's your mission . And when my old grad school buddy Jim and I left our cars last summer in Brookings x Ore . x the last coastal town before the California border x took a bus north with our bikes and gear to Coos Bay x and set out to cycle back x we found we had assigned ourselves one of the most spectacular missions imaginable . Where our route hugged the coast x the wows were almost continuous . Where it didn't x there was always a salt breeze luring us over the hills to the next harbor town .  We covered the 160 miles in a leisurely four days x allowing ourselves some detours and side trips x staying in nice lodges or motels x eating xwell in good restaurants and soaking up a ruggedly varied landscape of forest x field x mountain x sand and rock against a backdrop of sky and sea .  Coos Bay x a shipping and lumber mill town fallen on hard times x made for a dreary jump off . But its strip malls x shuttered mills and casino were behind us in a flash as we cruised a back road into pastures and wood lots . A spray of rosy purple fireweed nodded by the side of the road . warblers sang in the dark green firs . traffic was practically nil .  About three miles out of town x we descended a hill into tiny Charleston x working harbor x fish and chips shack x wind x tidal shallows raked by whitecaps . Here was the first fork in the road: either proceed directly to Seven Devils Road (named for its killer hills) x which would deliver us to Bandon x our destination for the night x or take a 10 mile side trip first on the Cape Arago Highway . We took the detour x and the oceanside parks x headland and lighthouse at Cape Arago were indeed lovely . But it was 2 pm by the time we had finished sniffing the luxe ivory Elina roses and photographing the finches in the garden of a former private estate at Shore Acres State Park x and the Seven Devils still bristled ahead .  Some wag had spray painted graffiti on the approach to each of the fiendish hills x ''Devil #2 Doncha Love It'' . ''Devil # 6 x I Think'' . at the crest of the final devil x ''Let the Fun Begin .'' In truth x they weren't that hard .  Bandon itself turned out to be a xlittle West Coast slice of Nantucket with terrific beaches to the west . the silvery estuary of the Coquille River to the north and east . and galleries and restaurants in a compact Old Town . We had a superb dinner of fresh fava beans x feather light lasagna x sauteed local snapper and Walla Walla cabernet at the Alloro Wine Bar and spent a quiet night at the Lighthouse Bed and Breakfast . I was up the next morning in time to see the sun rise over the estuary before we set off again .  South of town x the lightly trafficked Bandon Loop Road parallels the coast for four and a half miles . There are a few too xmany cottages and motels x but you forget all about them when you stop to wander on the beach amid fantastically carved sea stacks and watch the colorful kites slashing against the sky .  The loop rejoined Route 101 x the rarely busy but occasional RV and truck encumbered Oregon Coast Highway x which we would be following for the bulk of our trip . Only about 23 miles of it remained on the way to Port Orford x our next overnight stop x but it was an inland stretch x past cranberry bogs and ranches x and more side roads called out . We had a picnic lunch (toted from Bandon) beside the grassy banks of the New River x and somehow 5 o'clock was upon us by the time we reached the turn off for Cape Blanco . Our guidebook insisted this was a must stop x the farthest west point on the Oregon coast x the state's oldest lighthouse x one of the windiest spots in the country x but it would add 10 miles to our day's trek x and I was bushed . Jim somehow succeeded in motivating me x and I have to admit that Cape Blanco was one of the high points .  The road climbs through rolling sheep pastures x which in the slanting afternoon light reminded me of Cornwall . Once we reached the headland x we hit wind powerful enough to knock us off our bikes x and so we walked the last couple of hundred yards over the moor to the stark circa 1870 lighthouse . With the sun spilling fire on the sea beneath us and the wind coursing through the tundra grass x we stood and stared for as long as we could withstand the blast .  Dusk was falling as we finally cruised into Port Orford x past a scattering of weathered wood frame houses and shops x a whiff of hot fat emanating from the Crazy Norwegian's fish and chips x spears of Douglas firs going green black in the fading light . And then x around a bend in the road x buildings and trees fell away and we were standing at the continent's edge x before a vast azure bowl of mountain x sea and sky .  Imagine the shabby picturesque waterfront of an outer Maine island fused onto the topographic drama of Big Sur: that's Port Orford . There's a salty x dreamy x small town vibe to the place . every street ends in blue sea framed by huge dark green humps of land . and x as we discovered when the sun came blazing up over the Coast Range the next morning x dazzling white light saturates the whole composition . Somehow the town's stark beauty was all the more exhilarating because we had arrived under our own steam .  At the New Age luxurious Wildspring Guest Habitat x where we had reserved a cabin x we soaked away the day's 48 miles of biking in a hot tub with glimpses of ocean below and stars glittering through fir boughs above .  From Port Orford south to Brookings x Route 101 stays close xlovely walk to Old Town and the beach . Doubles: $140 to $245 .

"379",300178,"The 35 year old federal law regulating tap water is so out of date that the water Americans drink can pose what scientists say are serious health risks x and still be legal .  Only 91 contaminants are regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act x yet more than 60 ,000 chemicals are used within the United States x according to Environmental Protection Agency estimates . Government and independent scientists have scrutinized thousands of those chemicals in recent decades x and identified hundreds associated with a risk of cancer and other diseases at small concentrations in drinking water x according to an analysis of government records by The New York Times .  But not one chemical has been added to the list of those regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act since 2000 .  Other recent studies have found that even some chemicals regulated by that law pose risks at much smaller concentrations than previously known . However x many of the act xlike particles of rust and dirt x staining the sides of the bathtub .  Maywood is only one square mile x but has three water systems . All are privately owned x so local officials have (no) not power except forcing them to follow federal and state regulations . About three quarters of the nation's water systems are private entities x beholden only to their xshare for cleaner water x they were told what was flowing from the taps satisfied the Safe Drinking Water Act x and so the managers didn't have to do more .  Indeed x some of the chemicals in Mr Husman's water x like manganese x which has been associated with Parkinson's disease x are essentially unregulated x and so the water system isn't required to remove them x even when particles float in a glass .  ''When I shower in the morning x it look xlike blood ,'' Mr Husman said . ''How can the government see this water x know it contains dangerous chemicals x and say it's legal .''  When a city council member named Felipe Aguirre lobbied for cleaner water x anonymous leaflets arrived . ''Felipe Aguirre has deceived the citizens of Maywood .'' one reads . ''Felipe Aguirre does not care that Maywood residents will be paying more for water already safe to drink .'' another says . ''Do you want this liar and corrupt politician to decide the future of Maywood and its residents .''  Water system managers say their water is safe . ''If it wasn't x the EPA . or the state would tell us to change ,'' said Gustavo Villa x general manager of Maywood Mutual Water Company No . 2 . Before taking his job in 2006 x Mr Villa drove 18 wheeler trucks x and had (no) not experience running a water system . He said the system was trying to install machinery to remove some manganese x but halted construction because of missing permits .  Lawmakers on Capitol Hill and in state legislatures have pursued options that could help Maywood and other cities . The California Legislature x for instance x this year passed a bill focused on Maywood that would revoke permits from the town's water systems if they can not ''deliver safe x wholesome and potable drinking water .''  In May x the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee passed the Water Infrastructure Financing Act x which x if approved by Congress and signed by President Obama x would authorize $14 .7 billion in loans to help states improve their systems .  And the EPA . recently said it would analyze a host of chemicals x known as endocrine disruptors x that some scientists have associated with cancer and other diseases . Congress called for such tests in 1996 x but the agency fail to xmeet deadlines for 13 years .  In the meantime x regulators struggle to explain to residents that even legal drinking water can pose risks . Some of them have recommended that people use home water filters .  Most people don't comprehend the complicated scientific papers that describe cancer risks x Dr . Parekh said . ''And if the law is working x they don't have to ,'' he added .

It is appalling that so much had to be given away to polluters . It stinks . It's a mess . I detest it .  Now let us get it passed in the Senate and make it law .  Why . Because x for all its flaws x this bill is the first comprehensive attempt by America to mitigate climate change by putting a price on carbon emissions . Rejecting this bill would have been read in the world as America voting against the reality and urgency of climate change and would have undermined clean energy initiatives everywhere .  More important x my gut tells me that if the US government puts a price on carbon x even a weak one x it will usher in a new mind set among consumers x investors x farmers x innovators and entrepreneurs that in time will make a big difference x much like the first warnings that cigarettes could cause cancer . The morning after that warning ((no) not one) noted at smoking the same again .  Ditto if this bill passes . Henceforth x every investment decision made in America x about how homes are built x products manufactured or electricity generated x will look xlike the Amazon .  We need Republicans who believe in fiscal conservatism and conservation joining this legislation in the Senate . We want a bill that transforms the whole country not one that just threads a political needle . I hope they start listening to green Republicans like Dick Lugar x George Shultz and Arnold Schwarzenegger .  I also hope we will hear more from President Obama . Something feels very calculating in how he has approached this bill x as if he doesn't quite want to get his hands dirty x as if he is ready to twist arms in private x but not much that if the bill goes down he will get tarnished .

After independence from Portugal in 1975 it became the battleground for one of Africa's most horrifying civil wars . An estimated one million people were killed during 16 years of fighting x and millions more were displaced . The ordeal not only made the gravely poor gravely poorer x it also destroyed whatever infrastructure colonialism had bequeathed .  Peace finally arrived in 1992 x and the two warring armies x the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique x or Frelimo x and the Mozambique National Resistance x or Renamo x were transformed into competing political parties . Frelimo was declared the winner of the nation's first three presidential elections x and the expectation this year had been a second term for President Armando E . Guebuza and a larger Frelimo majority in Parliament .  But then came an abrupt plot twist x the creation in March of the Mozambique Democratic Movement x or MDM . x by Daviz Simango x mayor of the seaport Beira . He had taken office in 2003 as a Renamo candidate and won re election last November as an independent x becoming the only (non) not Frelimo mayor in the nation . Mr Simango appeared to be that rare upstart who might one day be hard to stop .  Mr Simango x a 45 year old civil engineer x has a personal story as compelling as a Shakespearean tragedy .

He added: ''This country had been devastated by war x and for 10 or 15 years we were happy as long as the situation remained stable . This place had such a long way to go . there were vast improvements in all the poverty indicators . We had taken it for granted that Mozambique was on the right road . There is a perception now that there has been a turn of direction .''  But the donors say their options for censuring the government for a tainted election are limited .

The city tracks these emissions through an annual inventory x and the latest one x released last month x showed that emissions decline to xfurther reduce the city's carbon output . Focusing on buildings x the proposals call for mandatory energy audits of existing structures of 50 ,000 square feet or more and require the owners to make certain improvements to make the buildings more energy efficient .

"386",300230,"When it comes to the environment x Washington's attention is fixed these days on the Congressional battle over legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions . But there are other pollutants x so called ground level pollutants x as opposed to those that rise into the atmosphere x that also need urgent attention x starting with toxic mercury emissions from coal fired power plants .  For various reasons x mainly heavy industry lobbying x these emissions have escaped federal regulation x whereas mercury emissions from other sources like incinerators and cement kilns have not . But the prospects for regulating power plant emissions have greatly improved since President Obama came to town .  Lisa Jackson x the Environmental Protection Agency administrator x has begun a rule making process that could require some power plants to reduce mercury emissions by as much as 90 percent . The Government Accountability Office has just produced a report showing that such reductions are not only technologically possible but affordable x refuting industry's longstanding claim that mercury controls would be too xexpensive .  This is good news for the environment and for consumers . Mercury is a toxin that has been found in increasingly high concentrations in fish and poses human health risks x including neurological disorders in children . The nation's coal fired power plants produce 48 tons of it a year x a xlittle more than 40 percent of the total mercury emitted in the United States .  The Clinton administration talked about regulating mercury but fail to xdo it . The Bush administration issued a weak rule in 2006 that was struck down in federal court as not only inadequate but invalid .  The gist of the court's argument was that the Clean Air Act clearly stipulates that power companies must install state of the art x on site pollution equipment at each plant to control toxic substances including mercury . The Bush plan would have allowed power companies to escape such controls by purchasing emissions ''credits'' from power plants in other parts of the country . A trading system can make very good sense for greenhouse gas emissions x which disperse widely into the atmosphere . But mercury tends to deposit locally x and the Bush approach would have done (nothing) not reduce the pollution of local lakes and streams .  Fortunately x 18 states have laws or regulations requiring mercury reductions at coal fired power plants . And in four states x Massachusetts x Connecticut x New Jersey and Delaware x a number of plants have already deployed new control technologies . The GAO . x which studied 25 boilers at 14 plants with advanced technologies x found that x in some cases x mercury emissions had been reduced by as much as 90 percent at an average cost of $3dot6 million x or pennies a month on consumers' electric bills .  That is a mere fraction of the cost of the equipment necessary to control other ground level pollutants like sulfur dioxide x the acid rain gas . Ms Jackson should issue a tough rule to control mercury x knowing that it is essential to protect Americans and that the power companies can certainly afford to do what is needed .

"387",300231,"The Obama administration proposed rules on Tuesday that would impose the first nationwide limits on greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and require a nearly 40 percent increase in fuel efficiency for cars and light trucks sold in the United States by 2016 .  Officials said the rules offered concrete proof of the administration's commitment to address global xwarming climate change open in Washington and at the United Nations . Broader legislation to deal with climate change is haltingly moving through Congress .  The government projects that the vehicle regulations will raise new car and truck prices by an average of $1 ,100 x but that drivers will save $3 ,000 over the life of a vehicle in fuel bills . Officials also said the new program x which is to take effect in 2012 x would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by nearly a billion tons and cut oil consumption by 1dot8 billion barrels from 2012 to 2016 .  The regulations x 1 ,227 pages x will go through a 60 day public comment period before they become final early next year .  The emissions program was first announced in May by President Obama as a way of resolving legal and regulatory conflicts among several federal agencies and a group of states x led by California x that want to impose stricter mileage and emissions standards than those set by Congress and a succession of presidents .  Automakers had complained that they faced a thicket of varying rules that were almost impossible to xmeet . The Obama compromise was endorsed by all the major auto companies x state officials and most environmental advocates .  Addressing autoworkers at a General Motors plant in Lordstown x Ohio x Mr Obama said on Tuesday that the new rules would benefit manufacturers x workers and consumers .  ''For too xlong ,'' Mr Obama said x ''our auto companies faced uncertain and conflicting fuel economy standards . That made it difficult for you to plan down the road . That's why x today x we are launching x for the first time in history x a new national standard aimed at both increasing gas mileage and decreasing greenhouse gas pollution for all new cars and trucks sold in America .  ''This action will give our auto companies some long overdue clarity x stability and predictability .''  Lisa P . Jackson x the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency x which along with the Department of Transportation will enforce the new rules x said at a White House briefing x ''The new standards are aggressive and achievable x and ensure that consumers have a full range of vehicle choices .''  In addition to providing domestic and foreign auto manufacturers with a single national efficiency standard x the proposed rules allow them to continue to build and import all classes of vehicles x from the smallest gas electric hybrids to monster SUV .'s . The mileage standard varies by vehicle size x but companies will have to achieve a fleet average of 35 .5 miles a gallon in combined city and highway driving .  The regulations say that car companies can meet the new standards largely by using existing technologies .  ''These include improvements to engines x transmissions and tires . increased use of start stop technology . improvements in air conditioning systems (to the extent currently allowed by law) . increased use of hybrid and other advanced technologies . and the initial commercialization of electric vehicles and plug in hybrids ,'' the proposed regulations state .  Manufacturers can also claim credits toward the standards by selling so called flexible fuel vehicles capable of running on a combination of gasoline and ethanol x and by selling more efficient cars in California and in other states that planned to adopt its stringent rules . If all those tactics are fully employed x the standard comes down by 1 to 1dot5 miles a gallon by 2016 x according to analysts for environmental groups .  Automakers that sell fewer than 400 ,000 vehicles in the United States would be allowed to meet a weaker standard to keep per unit costs down . This group includes Mercedes Benz x BMW x Volkswagen and Subaru .  The United States Chamber of Commerce and a group of automobile dealers have already indicated their intent to challenge the rules in court x saying the EPA . does not Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers x the trade group representing most domestic and foreign car makers x endorsed it .

"390",300241,"The Obama administration's proposed designation of 200 ,000 square miles of Alaskan waters and sea ice as critical habitat for the polar bear is not encouraging news for the bear .

"395",300303,"In a move to protect endangered species x Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced Thursday that his department had reversed a Bush administration decision to double the amount of logging allowed in and around old growth forests in western Oregon .  Veering between swipes at ''indefensible'' moves by the Bush administration and pledges to step up noncontroversial timber sales x Mr Salazar said in a conference call with reporters that he was reinstating a compromise reached 15 years ago to limit logging with the goal of protecting watersheds x trout and salmon fisheries and endangered birds like the northern spotted owl .  ''Today we are taking action to reform the Department of Interior and correct mistakes by correcting legal shortcuts the late administration made at the end of its tenure ,'' Mr Salazar said .

Tom Strickland x the Interior Department's assistant secretary for fish x wildlife and parks x said in the conference call that such timber sales x now on a fast track x would most likely focus on smaller diameter trees .  But Ann Forest Burns x a spokeswoman for the American Forest Resource Council x a timber industry group x questioned that approach . ''Just thinning the second growth will not restore the health of these forests and will not what these communities need ,'' Ms Burns said .

"396",300304,"This has been a good month for the nation's forests . The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in California reinstated a landmark 2001 rule x the so called roadless rule x put in place by President Bill Clinton before he left office that prohibited commercial logging x mining and other development on about 58 million acres of national forests . The Bush administration spent years trying to undermine the rule .  Meanwhile x Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack gave his first major speech on forest policy . Agriculture secretaries x from both parties x have almost always preferred to focus on farming issues x and have treated the Forest Service as a stepchild x even though the 193 million acres of forests and protected grasslands it manages are vital to water xquality x wildlife and local economies .  Mr Vilsack's speech displayed a firm grasp of the importance of healthy forests x and he promised to work with landowners to keep even private forests in good shape . ''It is essential ,'' he said x in language not heard in his department x ''that we reconnect Americans across the nation with the natural resources and landscapes that sustain us .''  Mr Vilsack also pledged to find a better balance between commercial and environmental interests and to develop new regulations governing the management of the country's 155 national forests to replace Bush era rules invalidated by a lower court last year .  Ostensibly to promote regulatory efficiency x but mainly to xsupport either . Though upheld in California x the rule has twice been thrown out in district court in Wyoming . An appeal is now pending in the 10th Circuit x which Mr Vilsack has promised to join . He must also make sure that the Tongass National Forest is included in any new roadless plan despite the Alaska Congressional delegation's insistence that it be opened to logging .  Victory on these two fronts would open the way enforcement of the roadless rule almost everywhere in the country and allow Mr Vilsack to turn his full attention to other efforts needed to protect the forests .

"397",300307,"Correction Appended  For years x residents here complained about the yellow smoke pouring from the tall chimneys of the nearby coal fired power plant x which left a film on their cars and pebbles of coal waste in their yards . Five states x including New York and New Jersey x sued the plant's owner x Allegheny Energy x claiming the air pollution was causing respiratory diseases and acid rain . So three years ago x when Allegheny Energy decided to install scrubbers to clean the plant's air emissions x environmentalists were overjoyed . The technology would spray water and chemicals through the plant's chimneys x trapping more than 150 ,000 tons of pollutants each year before they escaped into the sky .  But the cleaner air has come at a cost . Each day since the equipment was switched on in June x the company has dumped tens of thousands of gallons of wastewater containing chemicals from the scrubbing process into the Monongahela River x which provides drinking water to 350 ,000 people and flows into Pittsburgh x 40 miles to the north .  ''It's like they decided to spare us having to breathe in these poisons x but now we have to drink them instead ,'' said Philip Coleman x who lives about 15 miles from the plant and has asked a state judge to toughen the facility's pollution regulations . ''We can't escape .''  Even as a growing number of coal burning power plants around the nation have moved to reduce their air emissions x many of them are creating another problem: water pollution . Power plants are the nation's biggest producer of toxic waste x surpassing industries like plastic and paint manufacturing and chemical plants x according to a New York Times analysis of Environmental Protection Agency data .  Much power plant waste once went into the sky x but because of toughened air pollution laws x it now often goes into lakes and rivers x or into landfills that have leaked into nearby groundwater x say regulators and environmentalists .  Officials at the plant here in southwest Pennsylvania x named Hatfield's Ferry x say it does not pose any health or environmental risks because they have installed equipment to limit the toxins the facility releases into the Monongahela River and elsewhere .  But as the number of scrubbers around the nation increases x environmentalists x including those in Pennsylvania x have become worried . The Environmental Protection Agency projects that by next year x roughly 50 percent of coal generated electricity in the United States will come from plants that use scrubbers or similar technologies x creating vast new sources of wastewater .  Yet (no) not federal regulations specifically govern the disposal of power plant discharges into waterways or landfills . Some regulators have used laws like the Clean Water Act to combat such pollution . But those laws can prove inadequate x say regulators x because they do not mandate limits on the most dangerous chemicals in power plant waste x like arsenic and lead .  For instance x only one in 43 power plants and other electric utilities across the nation must limit how much barium they dump into nearby waterways x according to a Times analysis of EPA . records . Barium x which is commonly found in power plant waste and scrubber wastewater x has been linked to heart problems and diseases in other organs .  Even when power plant emissions are regulated by the Clean Water Act x plants have often violated that law (without) not paying fines or facing other penalties . Ninety percent of 313 coal fired power plants that have violated the Clean Water Act since 2004 were not fined or otherwise sanctioned by federal or state regulators x according to a Times analysis of Environmental Protection Agency records . (An interactive database of power plant violations around the nation is available at www .nytimescom/coalplants .)  Fines for Plants Modest  Other plants have paid only modest fines . For instance x Hatfield's Ferry has violated the Clean Water Act 33 times since 2006 . For those violations x the company paid (less) not $26 ,000 . During that same period x the plant's parent company earned $1dot1 billion .  ''We know xwell as public officials in 13 states x blocked the effort . In 2008 alone x according to campaign finance reports x power companies donated $20 million to the political campaigns of federal lawmakers x almost evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans .  In interviews x EPA . officials said that toughening pollution rules for power plants was among their top priorities . Last month x the agency announced it was moving forward on new rules regulating greenhouse gas emissions from hundreds of power plants and other large industrial facilities . Lisa P . Jackson x who was confirmed to head the agency in January x has said she would determine by the end of the year whether certain power plant byproducts should be treated as hazardous waste x which would subject them to tougher regulations .  But for now x there are (no) not new rules on power plant waste . And many states are trying to dissuade Ms Jackson from creating new regulations x according to state and federal regulators x because they worry that new rules will burden overworked regulators x and because power plants have pressured local politicians to fight greater regulation .  For instance x Pennsylvania has opposed designating the waste from Hatfield's Ferry and other power plants as hazardous . In a statement x the Department of Environmental Protection said the state had ''sufficient state and federal laws and regulations at our disposal to control wastewater discharges at levels protective of the environment and public health .''  But residents living near power plants disagree .  ''Americans want cheap electricity x but those of us who live around power plants are the ones who have to pay for it ,'' Mr Coleman said .

"398",300327,"Even if it were the only one of its kind x Mike Estes's brand new x energy efficient x wind powered x water conserving x environmentally sensitive John Deere dealership here would attract considerable attention in Kansas . This is a state that consistently ranks among the top 10 in oil and xnatural gas production x and routinely elects to Congress skeptics on matters of energy conservation and environmental regulation .  But in July x Mr Estes's 28 ,500 square foot x $3 million BTI Greensburg dealership (BTI stands for Bucklin Tractor and Implement x the name of the original store x which has since expanded to four locations) earned the United States Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design platinum certification x the highest designation x Six other buildings anticipate LEED certification .  While many of the nation's biggest cities do not single platinum development x BTI was not first building in Greensburg to receive it . That distinction goes to the 1 ,670 square foot Arts Center at the center of town x designed x built and opened a year ago by graduate students of the University of Kansas School of Architecture . The center is powered by windmills and a bank of solar photovoltaic panels x and heated and cooled by a state of the art geothermal system . It was the first LEED platinum building in Kansas .  That such visionary development is occurring in this sun washed x wind whipped agricultural community of 900 residents can be attributed to a single event: a monstrous tornado in May 2007 that killed 11 people .  In the weeks after x as federal and state officials assessed the damage and estimated the cost of rebuilding x business and civic leaders gathered with residents to come up with a reconstruction plan . The most important goal x city leaders said in interviews x was to build a xsense of economic dynamism that would generate new businesses and jobs and persuade Greensburg's talented young people not leave .  ''We had the chance to start over ,'' Mr Estes said . ''What do you do when you start with a clean slate . You want to build it better . Right .''  And so his company decided to incorporate in the new dealership x the old one was wrecked in the tornado x design features like skylights and electrical systems that cut energy use by half x plumbing fixtures that save almost 40 ,000 gallons of water a year x and two wind turbines out back that spin in a steady wind and generate a part of the dealership's electricity .  The first gatherings after the tornado produced a surprising civic consensus in a community where ''green roofs'' and the ''heat island effect'' were foreign concepts . As Dea Corns x a real estate agent who manages the Greensburg State Bank with her husband x Thomas V . Corns x recalls x ''We decided to put the 'green' in Greensburg .''  These days x the technical language of the green building world is in everyday use as Greensburg sets out to achieve the distinction that the former Kansas governor x Kathleen Sebelius x now the secretary of Health and Human Services x described in a news conference two years ago . ''We have an opportunity of having the greenest town in rural America ,'' she said .  Last year x leaders approved a redevelopment plan drawn up by the architectural firm BNIM x based in Kansas City x Mo . x that called for Greensburg to be a ''truly sustainable community that balances the economic x ecological and social impacts of development ,'' and ''a laboratory for research on sustainable design and community development .''  Greensburg also approved an ordinance requiring that all municipal buildings larger than 4 ,000 square feet be built to LEED platinum standards x putting it in the forefront among communities in the United States in energy conservation standards .  BTI's John Deere dealership is a small part of a bustling panorama of development whose total cost is expected to reach $100 million . Financing comes from a xmix with energy efficiency x water conservation and other environmental values in mind .  The National Renewable Energy Lab x a unit of the federal Department of Energy that advised the city in green development x tested 100 of Greensburg's recently built homes and found that x on average x they consumed roughly 40 percent (less) not energy than those they replaced .  Greensburg is also among the first in the nation to light its streets with LED lamps x which focus their beams on the ground and make it possible to see the stars . The new lamps also save 70 percent in energy and maintenance costs over the old sodium vapor lights x and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40 tons a year x city leaders say .  And Greensburg is planning to generate all of its electricity from the wind . Outside of town x John Deere Renewable Energy x an Iowa based unit of the equipment maker that has built wind farms in other Midwest states x is planning to break ground on a 12 .5 megawatt wind farm that consists of 10 turbines capable of supplying electricity to 4 ,000 homes .  Mr Estes is so enthusiastic that he embraced a new clean energy business plan that responds directly to the city's goal of generating new jobs .  BTI is now the national distributor of Canadian built Endurance Wind Power turbines capable of powering homes and businesses .

He accused the mayor x a former media mogul x of turning New York City into ''a wonderland for Wall Street and a dreamland for developers .''  His speech x delivered in Staten Island x far from the gilded corridors of Manhattan x took direct aim at Mr Bloomberg's justification for rewriting the term limits law last xfall: that he is uniquely skilled to manage the city's finances in a time of economic crisis .  ''Sadly ,'' Mr Thompson said x ''this is an eight year old story of mismanagement .''  Mr Thompson x who as the city comptroller is New York's chief financial watchdog x laid out a series of policy proposals that he said would begin to reverse the economic disparities that have deepened under Mr Bloomberg .  He called for the creation of retail retention zones to protect small businesses threatened by national chains x with incentives offered to landlords in return for low rents . a moratorium on the rezoning of 1 ,800 acres of manufacturing space x to promote the expansion of existing companies . and the creation of a new mayoral office to coordinate work force development programs throughout the city .

He called the city's $1 billion work force training system ''uncoordinated and often at odds with itself .'' He said the city has ''operated (without) not comprehensive economic plan .''  And criticizing the mayor's pursuit of splashy developments x he said: ''Enormous staff resources and time were wasted planning a West Side Jets Stadium that was (never) not built . Huge subsidies went to the New York Yankees for a stadium project with (little) not local economic impact .''

"408",300430,"AT first glance x the vast x empty expanse of the plaza of Villa de Leyva x a colonial city that is three and a half hours by car or bus from Bogota x seems designed to reduce the onlooker to a contemplation of his or her own insignificance . One of the largest town squares in South America x the Plaza Mayor lack xin xColombia and elsewhere x with only the paving stones giving it shape and form .  But as the sun begins to drop down toward the nearby mountains x the plaza can quietly dazzle . As I stepped into its vastness x with an expanse framed by the remarkable colonial buildings that define its perimeter x the centuries past seemed near . By sundown x tourists x mostly Colombian x and locals begin to traverse its length to fetch dinner or sit on the steps of the church to watch people or the sunset .  Like the plaza that defines it x the city does not flaunt its charms x but requires a willingness to go beyond that which lies in plain sight .  ''You have to go inside these walls to see what is really here ,'' said John Otis x an American journalist living in Bogota who served as our host .  We had been traveling by bicycle in the Boyaca region and elsewhere x including a glorious 10 mile descent to the Villa de Leyva x which served as an end point after a week of pedaling through smaller mountain villages . The rough hewn stones of Villa de Leyva pushed us off our bikes x and we settled in for a few days of R and R .  Villa de Leyva x founded in 1572 x meets contemporary life on its own terms . Declared a national monument in 1954 x it's an aggressively preserved colonial city x so the clank of the modern rarely interrupts the seance with the past . Long a weekend destination for Bogota residents seeking a (less) not frantic respite x Villa de Leyva has become a place where Europeans and the occasional American visit to see what made the Spaniards plant a flag there in the first place .  With its uneven streets that threaten even the hardiest vehicle x the spot invites x requires x in fact x strolling (although darkness and a bit too xmuch of the local rum can make walking a hazard as xwell) . Situated in a high mountain valley x the city of 4 ,000 or so also serves as a base camp for outings in the surrounding hills . And x indeed x many Colombians are fond of nighttime horseback rides and mountain biking . The tranquil comforts of Villa de Leyva x with its xmix with flower pots overflowing with bougainvilleas and geraniums . Abundant fossils from the surrounding area are embedded into plaster walls x and massive front doors are flanked by carvings x some echoing the occupation of the original residents . Once you leave the old city and venture into the more modern part of town x don't be surprised to see a yard full of chickens or goats next to an Internet cafe .  Evenings in town are equally seductive . On a Thursday night in July on the plaza x a group was gathered around several guitars and a harmonica at Terraza x a patio bar where Europeans and Colombians gathered to drink rum and warble Spanish love songs .  One duo enjoying the bar that evening turned out to be a brother and sister from Belgium x who ended up in Villa de Leyva a bit accidentally . They had begun the day headed to San Gil x a few hours north of Bogota x for some adventure travel x from the bus station in Bogota x but were victimized by a set of thieves in fake uniforms .  ''It happened very xquick look xlike Bogota and Cartagena . Villa de Leyva is bound to get some attention because of its ancient x at least in New World terms x origins x and because of its popularity with the Colombians themselves . There is an impressive array of hotels x haciendas for rent and other accommodations . The hotels are relatively cheap and often spectacular on a small scale x particularly the courtyards x which are so inviting and restful that it can be difficult to get motivated and hit the streets .  When you do x though x those uneven thoroughfares serve as a reminder that when you really want to come to know a place x you should look xlike you .''  STOP AND SMELL THE FRAILEJON  GETTING THERE  Continental offers direct round trip flights to Bogota from Newark x starting at $443 for travel in November x according to a recent Web search . cheaper flights are available out of Kennedy Airport on JetBlue x with a layover in Orlando x Fla . x starting at $229 in November . Flights fill up xquick to others on these unfamiliar mountain roads . You can find schedules from the main bus terminal to Villa de Leyva at www .terminaldetransporte .gov .co) x with round trip tickets running about 65 ,000 pesos x or about $34 at 1 ,915 Colombian pesos to the dollar .  Buses also leave frequently for Tunja x the capital of Boyaca x where you can make the xshort hop on a smaller bus (www .expovillacom/english/transport .htm) .  If you prefer to do the trip from the backseat of a car x work with a hotel to find a car service rather than negotiating with individual cabs x and expect to pay about 300 ,000 pesos . The road to Villa de Leyva is secure and full of tourists .  WHERE TO STAY  There is an array of wonderful hotels in Villa de Leyva x with varying prices and amenities . Hotel la Posada de San Antonio (Carrera 8 x 11 80 . 57 8 732 0538) x just a block off the main square x offers pleasant rooms x a lovely courtyard and a reliable restaurant . Rates start at 190 ,000 pesos for a double . Situated in the surrounding hills x the pricier Duruelo Inn (Carrera 3 x 12 88 . 57 8 732 0222 . www .duruelocom .co) is gorgeous x with grand vistas and first rate pools . Doubles start at 313 ,000 pesos .  WHERE TO EAT  Food is mostly fuel in Villa de Leyva x but there are a few exceptions worth seeking out . The Pasteleria Francesa (Calle 10 x 9 41) x just off the square x serves exquisite French pastries and good coffee . Just across the street x Maria Elisa Rojas serves the empanadas and tamales typical of her native California in a lovely space . pitchers filled with all manner of local juices add even more color to the table .  DAY TRIPS  El Fosil x a museum about three miles from town x lives up to its name with an almost complete kronosaurus x a giant and prehistoric gatorlike marine reptile . You can take a cab or bus to the museum . admission is 3 ,100 pesos . By bus x head toward Santa Sofia and tell the driver you want to get off at El Fosil . from the roadside x it's about a 10 minute walk to the museum .  The more ambitious will opt for a hike above the tree line at Iguaque Sanctuary and National Park (www .presidencia .gov .co/parques . admission x 14 ,400 pesos) . To get to Iguaque x about a half hour outside of town x arrange a car or taxi through your hotel x including a prearranged pickup time .  Plan on at least two and a half hours for the hike up x an hour at the top and a one and a half hour descent . Iguaque was described to us as a nice (little) not hike x but don't believe it for a minute . Wear good shoes and bring a backpack with plenty of snacks and water .  On the path up you might think you were walking through a butterfly exhibition the air is so thick with fluttering wings . Over a path that is mostly roots and rocks x you will make your way from a subtropical forest up into the clouds and the lakes and past the hairy x otherworldly frailejon plants that decorate the top of the mountain . (A high school biology teacher from Argentina who joined us for the trek up was in a constant state of wonder .)  The descent has its own perils x so don't let a combination of fatigue and impatience push you faster than you should go .  A note on clothing . Remember that although most of Colombia is near the equator x high altitudes can mean lower temperatures x so bring layers . URL: http://www .nytimescom","Positive",7806
"409",300433,"A deadly wildfire that has burned for nearly a week in the foothills north of here has destroyed dozens of homes and threatened thousands of others on Monday x frustrating firefighters with its unusually rapid and unpredictable spread .  The fire x burning in rugged terrain at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains about 20 miles north of downtown Los Angeles x has consumed more than 100 ,000 acres x or more than 150 square miles x about the size of the Bronx and Queens combined .  The authorities did not precise tally of the damage x but said at least 70 homes and probably many more x some of them vacation cabins x some single family residences x had been destroyed x mostly in remote areas . More than 3 ,670 firefighters and support personnel struggled to track the blaze's erratic spread and keep flames from encroaching on large neighborhoods and communities abutting the wilderness .  ''This is a very angry fire ,'' said Mike Dietrich x a commander with the United States Forest Service x who added that he expected it could take two weeks to surround and extinguish it .  Though not driven by wind like many catastrophic fires here x this blaze x fueled by brush dried in record setting heat and a 10 year drought x confounded emergency workers .  Just as the authorities cleared some residents to return and cleared brush and dug trenches to block flames advancing on neighborhoods x new evacuations were ordered in the eastern San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles as towering flames crept over ridgelines and took aim at houses below .  The fire x whose cause is unknown x claimed the lives of two Los Angeles County firefighters on Sunday after their truck overturned and fell 800 feet down a hillside as they tried to (avoid) not burst of fire bearing down on them . The men died from injuries suffered in the crash and from the advancing flames x the department said .  A few other people have been injured x including two people who refuse to xevacuate and sought cover from the flames in a backyard hot tub as the fire barreled through the area x the authorities said .  Some 4 ,000 homes were ordered evacuated x but law enforcement authorities estimated only half of the people complied x preferring to stay behind to try to help save their homes .  Frank Bagheri x 48 x who reluctantly left his home near La Canada Flintridge on Sunday morning with his family x said he saw a few neighbors stay behind hosing down their lawns and houses .  ''We finally left because I stopped one of the firefighters running around our street ,'' Mr Bagheri said . ''I wanted to ask him whether the fire would go the other way x or if we would be OK He just looked at me and said x 'You don't want to stay here and get trapped .' That phrase x stay here and get trapped x did it . I changed my mind at that point to leave .''  The fire x called the Station Fire for its origin on Wednesday near a ranger station in the Angeles National Forest x sent a towering plume skyward visible from almost all of metropolitan Los Angeles x a stark herald of the fire season that peaks in late summer and fall . It spread a fog of unhealthful x brownish air across a vast swath of the region x and officials said it could take two weeks to put it out .  For some time x the authorities said they were worried that the flames would overrun Mount Wilson x which includes an observatory and transmission facilities for some FM radio and television stations . But thanks in part to rapid brush clearing x crews stationed in the area and an aerial bombardment by planes dropping water and flame retardant x the fire was kept back .  A spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department x Steve Whitmore x said many people had defied evacuation orders x though x to (avoid) not burden on resources x officers were noting arrests . A group of people in the Gold Creek area on Monday afternoon who had refuse to xevacuate were trapped x and crews struggled to reach them . One of the men told radio station KNX AM by phone that they were all right and that the fire did not close .

"410",300439," FLYING chips of ice sparkled in the July sun as I hammered a pick into the 1 ,200 foot high sheet of ice and snow called the Dana Couloir in Yosemite National Park . I was suspended on the side of a mountain in a couloir x an icy gully x by the points of my crampons and the ice axes I held in either hand . Couloir climbing is a summer sport in the Sierra Nevada x but it might not around much longer .  Our plan was to reach the summit of Mount Dana x at 13 ,057 feet the second tallest peak in Yosemite after Mount Lyell x via the couloir and return in a single day . That morning rising in the dark x my guides x Kurt Wedberg and Sara Berghoff x and I hoisted our packs by the light of headlamps . We hiked along a marshy trail as the first rays of the sun glinted on Tioga Lake .  We were carrying the ropes x ice screws x helmets x climbing harnesses and other gear we would need safely to ascend the couloir leading toward the summit . An early start meant that we would have more daylight x firmer ice to climb on and (less) not chance of falling rocks loosened by the xwarming climate change the snow to ice process in the Sierra begins and ends earlier in the year .  At midmorning it felt xlike fall when we reached Dana Lake x a barren pond at the bottom of a rocky glacial valley . We hiked to the edge of Dana Glacier x one of about 100 glaciers remaining in the Sierra . They were most likely formed during the Little Ice Age x from about 1450 to 1850 . Photographic records show that Dana Glacier has shrunk to one third the size it was in 1883 and is continuing to recede with climate change .  Connie Millar x a research scientist with the United States Forest Service x said ice climbing at Dana Couloir x above the glacier x could disappear within a couple of decades if temperatures continued their warming trend .  The glacier at the base of the couloir was cut with crevasses x so we put on crampons and harnesses and roped up for safety . The going seemed easy for Mr Wedberg x who has twice summited Mt . Everest x but I stumbled . Mr Wedberg had me short roped x and he xquick to arrest a fall . When he had nearly reached the end of the rope x he stopped climbing and set up a second anchor . It was my turn to follow on one of the ropes .  Breathing hard in the thin air x I alternated hammering one of the tools into the ice and then kicking in the points of a crampon . It was xlike a sunny winter's day . I followed a darker ribbon of ice gleaming in the snow x protect xagainst a fall by the rope as Mr Wedberg belayed me from above .  Then it was Ms Berghoff's turn to climb on the second rope after disassembling the first anchor . When she reached us x she passed the ice screws back to Mr Wedberg for the next anchor . As the sun rose higher rocks the size of grapefruit x loosened by the melting snow and ice x whizzed down the left side of the couloir .  The couloir x nearly as high as the top floor of the Empire State Building x hadn't seemed so imposing at the base . Now it stretched out far below us . It wasn't hard to imagine slipping and tumbling forever xlike a rag doll x and I was glad for the rope's protection . We could see the deep x almost tropical x blues and greens of Dana Lake far below us .  The last hour of climbing was a boulder hopping exercise along the bare x brown shoulder of the mountain . When we finally reached the summit x a jumble of fractured gray rocks x we had a 360 degree view that included much of Yosemite National Park and the Sierra Nevada and Mono Lake and the Wassuk Range in Nevada to the east .  Summer had returned on the sunny southern side of the mountain as we soon started down a hikers' trail . Our long descent zigzagged down across talus fields of brown rock x then through meadows x finally ending near the eastern entrance station to Yosemite National Park . The early evening alpenglow lighted the mountains above us as we walked along the roadway back to our cars . I was bone tired but happy to have experienced a year of seasons in one summer's day .

"412",300486," A YEAR ago x the Iowa River broke through a levee three blocks from Ed Fisher's tropical fish store and wiped him out .  Ed had opened Coralville Bay five years earlier . The store was named for its location off Highway 6 x which links the town of Coralville to Iowa City . Coralville itself is named for the Devonian era fossils in its foundation x reminders of another water covered time long ago .  Until last June x business was fine . Local doctors peered into his tanks for the fish that calmed their waiting rooms . Parents sought ''bread and butter'' fish x guppies x goldfish . College boys bought piranhas .  Then there were customers whom Ed affectionately calls ''fish geeks .'' Some cultivate saltwater fish far from the ocean . ''It's a nice accomplishment ,'' he explained x ''to say x 'I am in the middle of Iowa and I can raise fish that thrive in South America .''' Among the fish geeks of Eastern Iowa x Ed was ''a bit known for carrying unusual and rare stuff .''  Then the Flood of 2008 rolled in and left Ed and his neighbors under several feet of water .  For business owners like Ed x last year's floods have virtually eclipsed the recession . He was unable to xenter the building for two weeks . Without electricity to pump oxygen x most of his stock perished x including a tank of Amazonian discus fish valued at almost $2 ,000 . Like many local business owners x Ed had (no) not flood insurance . And to complete his desolation x the flood had left him homeless . Since he focused his efforts on trying to save his store x he managed to salvage only a few armfuls of clothing from his apartment .  But in the aftermath of the flood and even in this recession x Ed has found a way to survive . In Ed's case x recovery arose from the atypical business elements of luck x human kindness and a personal resilience borne of what he calls ''silver lining thinking .''  ''You keep look xlike x 'You want this wall down . OK' It just lifted your spirits .''  A few weeks ago x he began to stock fish in the new store . ''We have been ringing the register . We are seeing old customers x through word of mouth .'' Outside sits Ed's familiar van . Covered with fish decals and the name of the store x the van is the only major possession he managed to save . Its brakes are gone now x and its main function is to direct customers to the store .  Ed doesn't know how the recession is going to affect his comeback . The flood began our economic struggle a few months early x and it's hard to see one from the other . But he said: ''I am in a honeymoon period . Right now x I am probably feeling the recession (less) not most people .''  Many neighboring businesses did not return . ''You look around the street and a lot of people weren't able to come back ,'' he said . He counts himself as lucky . ''We are just a xlittle goofy fish store and I think we are going to make it .''

Formally listed as an endangered species in 1990 x the owl triggered a series of court cases that persuaded President Bill Clinton in 1994 to protect much of the old growth forest in the Pacific Northwest x the bird's habitat x from timber companies .  Though the Clinton plan allowed some logging x it was considerably more favorable to the owl and its habitat than it was to industry . Bowing to industry pressure x the Bush administration decided last year to double the allowable logging on 2dot6 million acres of prime owl habitat in Oregon and to rescind other protections .  On Thursday x the interior secretary x Ken Salazar x announced that he would reverse those decisions x reaffirming the Clinton plan . This is an important victory for the owl and for the irreplaceable old growth forests where it lives x which is partly what this fight has been about from the beginning . It is also a victory for the Endangered Species Act .

"416",300505,"A GLANCE at Lawrence Greene's rustic colonial with wraparound porch in Livingston Manor x NY x might lead one to believe it's a 150 year old farmhouse . In fact x it's two years old x one of the greenest houses in New York State x and built in a factory .  The 1 ,800 square foot structure was constructed by New World Home x a company that offers environmentally xresponsib for $360 ,000 in March and uses it on weekends .  ''It's a house that one can feel xlike two 1860 fireplace mantels from brownstones in New York City x antique chandeliers and an elderly claw foot tub . Mr Greene said he had to convince the building inspector that it wasn't a restored house . But x at the same time x plumbers and electricians have marveled at the hardware in his very 21st century basement .  New World Home ''applies great ingenuity x not only in terms of how to build a house that's ecologically favorable x but also that is aesthetically enviable ,'' Mr Greene said .  Modular construction x houses manufactured as modules at a factory and then assembled on site x is inherently greener than conventional ''stick built'' construction x said Mark Jupiter x a founder and the president of the product division of New World x which is two years old and has headquarters in Manhattan . Fewer materials are used and (less) not waste is generated x he said .  ''The efficiencies and economies of scale that a factory brings just blow site built houses out of the water x if done right ,'' Mr Jupiter said .  New World's houses have more than two dozen other features that make them eco friendly x including metal roofing with recycled content and motion detecting light switches . They have hookups for mechanical systems like solar panels x geothermal energy or wind turbines x but don't depend upon them for their green status .  ''A green house x to truly call it that x can't rely on mechanical systems ,'' Mr Jupiter said . ''The only thing that's truly going to make a house green is the thermal envelope being as tight as possible . That means building a house that doesn't leak at all x combined with proper insulation for the region x and choosing to eliminate contaminants within the construction materials .''  The houses cut energy consumption in half and reduce water use by 20 ,000 gallons annually x providing homeowners with big savings x beginning the first day of occupancy x Mr Jupiter said .  Mr Greene's house has double paned windows for insulation x and ceiling fans and cross ventilation cool the home (without) not air conditioning .  ''The front door doesn't even have a storm door ,'' Mr Greene said . ''And it's so secure and airtight that (no) not cold air gets inside in the winter x and it's perfectly cool when you walk inside in the summer on the hottest day .''  New World Home doesn't build its own homes x but gives its specifications to modular builders like Future Home Technology in New York and Haven Custom Homes of Maryland . The houses can be built for as xlittle as $70 ,000 with (no) not upper limit on price for custom built homes x said Tyler Schmetterer x the company's other founder and chief operating officer .  Only two or three companies now produce green modular housing routinely x and typically their prices range from $250 to $800 a square foot . New World averages about $150 to $200 a square foot . The company is also exploring affordable housing x which would be $70 a square foot .  Both Mr Schmetterer and Mr Jupiter acknowledge that they have had to struggle to overcome a stereotype that plagues the modular construction industry x one of flimsy wooden structures and unattractive vinyl siding .  ''That stigma is slowly but surely becoming archaic and will eventually become extinct ,'' Mr Jupiter said .  New World Home's principals say they can build a house in 60 to 90 days . If homeowners choose x they can apply for certification from the United States Green Building Council and the National Green Building Program . This can be useful in states that encourage green building practices x like New York x which will offer up to $7 ,500 per qualifying single family home starting Jan 1 .  ''Eventually x if people decide to move x the green certification should significantly contribute to the resale value of the home asxwell'' Mr Schmetterer said .  New World Home is partnering with developers to create subdivisions in about 10 states x along with individual homes . Besides Mr Greene's x New World has completed one in Jeffersonville x NY x and now has houses under construction in East Hampton x Millbrook and Cornwall x NY  Mr Greene said he bought his weekend home for its quaint historic ambience more than anything else .  ''The idea that the home was eco friendly was x in a way x icing on the cake x because it was so delightful in many ways ,'' he said . ''So I do my best to uphold the standard by not things like applying weed killer or insecticides to the lawn . I am really trying to do things that are ecologically sensitive now .''

The Coast Guard was alerted to the accident at 3 pm Monday x and by Tuesday x it was assisting the rescue ships from the Turks and Caicos with helicopters x a C 130 transport plane and a cutter x the Valiant .  The rescue craft picked up 118 survivors x most of them stranded on the shallow coral reef x the Coast Guard said . Petty Officer Johnson said two bodies had been recovered near the reef . most of the other 13 were found slightly farther north .  The search effort x covering 1 ,600 square miles x ran the course of the day . ''We searched through the night and have been at it full force since first light ,'' Petty Officer Johnson said .

''All they have is a sail and a rudder x and when they head north x (avoiding) not these hazards becomes extremely difficult .''  The survivors were shuttled from the reef by boat and helicopter to Providenciales x another island in the western part of the archipelago .

A toxic cocktail of dioxin x sewage x heavy metals and industrial chemicals left behind by the factories x tanneries x smelters and refineries that are now mostly hulking brick ruins x the Passaic is a pretty decisive argument against human perfectibility .  The Passaic begins in the clear trout streams of rural Morris County x provides drinking water to 3dot5 million New Jersey residents x reaches a peak at the Great Falls of Paterson and then devolves at the end of 80 increasingly foul and dispiriting miles into a dark x malodorous industrial sink .

"424",300578,"A New York State board has recommended a plan intended to make energy more affordable x efficient and environmentally friendly while helping to create jobs over the next 10 years x officials said .  The plan x released Tuesday by the State Energy Planning Board x is not binding x but Gov . David A . Paterson x who convened the board last year x said the recommendations will guide legislation he plans to pursue in the year ahead .  ''New York will lead the nation in the clean energy economy x and this state energy plan will help us get there ,'' Governor Paterson said in a statement .  The plan includes improvements in energy efficiency x more reliance on state energy supplies like xnatural gas and increased investment in clean energy projects as a source of jobs .  One initiative in the plan x which updates energy goals set in a similar report in 2002 x calls for a new state building code that would require stricter energy efficiency standards . Another calls for disclosing energy use for buildings at the time of sale to encourage energy upgrades . The plan also calls for expanding solar and wind energy projects while doubling the state's production of xnatural gas x a (less) not polluting fossil fuel than coal .  Thomas Congdon x the deputy secretary of energy for Governor Paterson and the board's chairman x said the plan was critical to the broad goal of meeting 45 percent of the state's electricity needs by 2015 by increasing its reliance on renewable energy and keeping a lid on overall demand . He said it emphasized energy efficiency more than previous blueprints and laid out a timetable for action by government agencies and lawmakers .  ''It's one of the most aggressive clean energy targets in the country x with a very detailed implementation plan to get us there ,'' he said .  But while generally praising the plan's comprehensiveness x environmentalists and other supporters of the state's goals said that it fell short on setting specific targets x and some were skeptical about how much of it would end up being implemented . James Van Nostrand x executive director of the Pace Energy and Climate Center x said that 10 months after the governor announced his ''45 percent by 2015 goal ,'' the State Public Service Commission has yet to take specific action to help finance some of the programs that would help meet that goal .  ''In our experience New York has (never) not problem identifying policy objectives ,'' Mr Van Nostrand said . ''It's just the implementation that is slow .''  But some business groups said they were optimistic that some of their priorities would be addressed . They particularly welcomed the plan's embracing of legislation to establish a uniform statewide permit process to speed up the approval of applications for power plants .

President Obama x both during his campaign and in his first year in office x has promoted the promise of new jobs in cutting edge x nonpolluting industries x and such green jobs will be a major issue at his jobs ''summit'' meeting Thursday .  But x increasingly x skeptics who point to the need for more jobs are wondering why he is not more to create green jobs faster .  Growth in clean energy industries and in green jobs has been considerably slower and bumpier than anticipated x industry experts say .  But rather than giving up on its green jobs mantra x the White House will rededicate itself to promoting green industries at the jobs meeting x which will bring together business and labor leaders x politicians and economists .  The initial promise of green jobs was based on governments around the world declaring the fight against global warming to be a priority . The theory was that jobs in environmentally minded companies would grow rapidly as a result . But instead x some green industry companies have been shedding jobs in the United States x and in some cases moving them to China .  Last week x the Gamesa wind turbine plant in western Pennsylvania announced it was laying off nearly half its 280 workers . Last month x General Electric said it would close xhoped . The clean energy component of the $787 billion stimulus package has only recently started to kick in . Energy experts say that banks x which have been reluctant to lend generally x have been especially loath to lend for alternative energy projects .  And renewable energy companies are hesitating to invest in new plants and equipment before Congress enacts new environmental mandates x like cap and trade x to limit carbon emissions . In addition x the long recession (along with correspondingly slack energy demand) caused the clean energy industry to delay expansion plans .  As a result x the United States is likely to install just one eighth as much new solar power this year as Germany does x and China is expected to surpass the United States this year as the leader in adding new wind energy capacity .  ''The renewable energy industry in the US is an underdeveloped developing industry ,'' said Michael Peck x director of external affairs for Gamesa USA x a Spanish owned company that has two wind turbine factories in Pennsylvania . ''Manufacturers x developers x utilities x financiers x they don't see the legislative pieces that they are all hoping for to help the industry move forward .''  Recently x the Obama administration has taken several steps it says will soon produce thousands of green jobs . In August x it announced $2dot3 billion in tax credits that will go to manufacturers of clean energy technologies . It has also allocated $6 billion for loan guarantees that could x in turn x generate $60 billion in investments .  The administration notes that Solyndra x a company that makes solar photovoltaic panels in Fremont Calif . x received a $535 million loan guarantee to finance a manufacturing plant x creating 3 ,000 construction jobs and 1 ,000 permanent jobs .  In addition x the government's $11 billion program to modernize the nation's power grid x to make it easier to absorb electricity generated by wind and solar power x is just getting off the ground x officials say . They say the weatherization part of the stimulus package has already put many people to work in California x Ohio x Georgia and other states x and that number is expected to more than double this winter and spring .  While many green industry executives and environmental experts applaud these efforts x they say more needs to be done . Some note that even with the administration's recent moves x it has spent (less) not one fourth of the $80 billion clean energy component of the stimulus package .  Administration officials boast that the $80 billion figure is by far the largest amount ever committed to renewable energy .  Within industry and the environmental movement x there are recurring calls for Congress to require the nation to generate 15 percent or 20 percent of its energy through renewable sources by a specific year x say 2020 . General Electric x which has 10 ,000 wind turbines in the United States x says that to encourage growth in the wind industry x the nation should adopt a target of obtaining 12 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2012 .

''But I hope it will go xwell beyond simply a declaration of principles . The form I would like it to take is the groundwork for a ratifiable agreement next year .''  Negotiators have accepted as all but inevitable that representatives of the 192 nations in the talks will not resolve the outstanding issues in the time remaining before the Copenhagen conference opens in December . The gulf between rich and poor nations x and even among the wealthiest nations x is just too xwide .  Representatives of the 16 largest emitting countries and the European Union x who concluded a meeting in London on Monday x said that they had made progress on the level of aid needed to help poor countries adapt to climate change and adopt (less) not polluting energy technology .  They also said they had settled some questions on the ''architecture'' of any agreement reached in Copenhagen x while acknowledging that it would fall short of a binding treaty .  Yet expectations remain high for a meeting that carries important weight not for the environment but for a broad range of international issues x including trade x security x economic development x energy production x technology sharing and the survival of some vulnerable island nations .  So officials are now narrowing expectations and defining the areas where there is agreement x such as the need to halt and then reverse the growth of greenhouse gas emissions x although how and by which nations remain the subjects of intense dispute . Negotiators are also discussing what form any declaration that emerges from Copenhagen might take and how to ensure that any promises made there are kept .  Among the chief barriers to a comprehensive deal in Copenhagen is Congress's inability to enact climate and energy legislation that sets binding targets on greenhouse gases in the United States .

No numbers were attached to either of these pledges x and that remains the stickiest of issues .  Another unresolved issue is the financial structure of any international climate accord . The wealthy nations have agreed in principle to support low carbon growth in the developing world and to help those countries hardest hit by climate change to adapt . But the amounts of money x the programs and the countries that would qualify for that support and for cost sharing among donor nations are highly contentious issues unlikely to be settled in Copenhagen .  There will probably also be a promise to create an international system to monitor x report and verify emissions reductions x although there is (no) not consensus yet on who would perform these tasks and what penalties would be assessed for fail to xcomply .  There is also likely to be a commitment by most nations to produce and publish economic growth plans based on lower carbon emissions and an agreement by advanced nations to xshare in the administrations of Bill Clinton and George W .

"435",300642,"More than 20 percent of the nation's water treatment systems have violated key provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act over the last five years x according to a New York Times analysis of federal data .  That law requires communities to deliver safe tap water to local residents . But since 2004 x the water provided to more than 49 million people has contained illegal concentrations of chemicals like arsenic or radioactive substances like uranium x as xwell as dangerous bacteria often found in sewage .  Regulators were informed of each of those violations as they occurred . But regulatory records show that fewer than 6 percent of the water systems that broke the law were ever fined or punished by state or federal officials x including those at the Environmental Protection Agency x which has ultimate xresponsib for enforcing standards .  Studies indicate that drinking water contaminants are linked to millions of instances of illness within the United States each year .  In some instances x drinking water violations were one time events x and probably posed (little) not risk .

On Tuesday x the Senate Environment and Public Works committee will question a high ranking EPA . official about the agency's enforcement of drinking water safety laws .

The majority of drinking water violations since 2004 have occurred at water systems serving fewer than 20 ,000 residents x where resources and managerial expertise are often in xshort supply .  It is unclear precisely how many American illnesses are linked to contaminated drinking water . Many of the most dangerous contaminants regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act have been tied to diseases like cancer that can take years to develop .  But scientific research indicates that as many as 19 million Americans may become ill each year due to just the parasites x viruses and bacteria in drinking water . Certain types of cancer x such as breast and prostate cancer x have risen over the past 30 years x and research indicates they are likely tied to pollutants like those found in drinking water .  The violations counted by the Times analysis include only situations where residents were exposed to dangerous contaminants x and exclude violations that involved paperwork or other minor problems .  In response to inquiries submitted by Senator Boxer x the EPA . has reported that more than three million Americans have been exposed since 2005 to drinking water with illegal concentrations of arsenic and radioactive elements x both of which have been linked to cancer at small doses .  In some areas x the amount of radium detected in drinking water was 2 ,000 percent higher than the legal xlimit x according to EPA . data .  But federal regulators fined or punished fewer than 8 percent of water systems that violated the arsenic and radioactive standards . The EPA . x in a statement x said that in a majority of situations x state regulators used informal methods x like providing technical assistance x to help systems that had violated the rules .

"442",400162,"When Britain's top army commander visited British frontline troops in Helmand Province in Afghanistan on Wednesday x his means of transport x a United States Army Black Hawk helicopter x made almost as much news back home as the fact that he was in Afghanistan at all .  The commander x Gen . Sir Richard Dannatt x chief of the general staff x acknowledged x perhaps more candidly than he would have if he were not retiring imminently x that he had been forced to fly in an American helicopter because British forces x with only 30 helicopters for their 9 ,100 troops x could not spare one .  Instead x he relied on American forces x which have deployed hundreds of helicopters in the war zone .  ''Self evidently x if I move in an American helicopter x it's because I don't have a British helicopter ,'' the general said in a brusque BBC radio interview .  As he warmed to his theme of the equipment shortages facing British troops x he came close to joining a recent groundswell of criticism in which Prime Minister Gordon Brown's government has been accused of trying to conduct the war in Afghanistan (without) not adequate financing .  The debate has been keenly followed in Washington and is politically perilous for Mr Brown x who faces an uphill struggle if his Labour Party is to make a fight of a general election (less) not year away .  By the measure of its troop numbers x and its role in Helmand x the most violent theater of the war x Britain is the United States' most important ally among the 40 or more countries that contribute forces to the coalition military effort in Afghanistan . If Britain quit the war x as it has in Iraq x President Obama's commitment to prevailing in Afghanistan would suffer a major blow .  On Wednesday x the political battle moved to the House of Commons x where Mr Brown and David Cameron x the Conservative leader x had an illxtempered confrontation over the scarcity of helicopters . The issue has been highlighted as the conflict's touchstone issue by many of Britain's mass circulation newspapers and by the families of dead soldiers .  At the weekly xprime minister's questions x Mr Cameron accused Mr Brown of xresponsib for a $2dot3 billion cut in helicopter procurement five years ago x when Mr Brown was chancellor of the Exchequer . That decision x Mr Cameron suggested x was directly linked to situations in which British troops had to close on the enemy in armored vehicles and on foot x rather than aboard helicopters that would reduce their exposure to the most deadly form of Taliban attack x roadside bombs .  Few accusations could be more potentially damaging to Mr Brown x in the context of events in Afghanistan in recent days x including General Dannatt's trip x and the way it highlighted the helicopter shortage . In his trip on the Black Hawk x the general visited a forward operating base at the embattled town of Sangin x where five British soldiers from a single company were killed Friday in a double bombing by the Taliban .  The five were among eight British soldiers killed in a 24 hour period x the worst rush of casualties suffered by British troops in nearly 30 years . The five were victims of roadside bombs on an earthen pathway as they advanced on Taliban fighters . Three of the dead were 18 year old riflemen who rushed to the aid of soldiers hit by the first bomb x then were caught by the second .  The bomb attack has entered British folklore as the country has confronted x to a degree unmatched since its deployment to Afghanistan in 2001 x the realities facing its troops . The casualties so far this month x 15 in 10 days up to last Friday x have brought the number of British dead in the conflict to 184 . That is five more than the number of deaths in Britain's deployment in Iraq x which will end when the last main force troops (withdraw) notaw in the next two weeks .  The deaths' emotional impact was driven home on Tuesday when the eight soldiers who were killed at the end of last week were flown home . Britain's television channels provided live coverage as hearses bearing the coffins passed through towns x villages and expressway underpasses that were packed with mourners throwing flowers onto the passing cortege .  Nothing like it has been seen in Britain since the body of Diana x Princess of Wales x was carried to her family's countryside estate after her funeral in 1997 . It was an outpouring that underscored the volatility of public xsupport for the war . While opinion polls show a narrow majority in favor of having British troops remain in Afghanistan x many commentators here believe that the support could evaporate if casualties remain high and there is (no) not British helicopters deployed in Afghanistan had increased by 60 percent in the past two years x and that the government had budgeted nearly $10 billion to acquire more helicopters over the next 10 years . In any case x he said x the Sangin casualties x and many others in Afghanistan x were a result of ground combat that was necessary in the fight with the Taliban x regardless of the number of helicopters .  ''It is not absence of helicopters that is causing deaths ,'' he said .  But Mr Cameron said Britain's inability to field more than 30 helicopters x compared with the 100 helicopters he said were deployed by the United States Marine Corps in Afghanistan x with a number of troops similar to Britain's x could be traced back to Mr Brown's budget cutback in 2004 .

''Governors Island: The Jewel of New York Harbor'' (Syracuse University Press x $60) x by Ann L . Buttenwieser x an accomplished urban historian x is a vivid reminder of the city's military past x and x above all x of the vast potential for this underappreciated and underutilized oasis .  ''For 242 years ,'' Ms Buttenwieser writes x ''from the arrival of a British regiment in 1755 to the disestablishment ceremonies of the Coast Guard base there in 1997 x the lifeblood of Governors Island has been the military .'' Its military demands were xresponsib for x among other things x the nation's biggest regimental dormitory and what was billed as the world's shortest railroad .  While the text delves deeper into local arcana than an average reader might want to go x the book is richly adorned with evocative drawings x maps and photographs that trace the island's life x from the Dutch landing in 1624 to its military incarnations as a fort and a prison x to its role as a site of presidential summit meetings and Coast Guard rescue base and x finally x to its transfer from the federal government to the National Park Service and New York City and State .

The Bush administration captured about a dozen high ranking Al Qaeda members x including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed x the self proclaimed mastermind of 9/11 . But President Bush refuse to xsubject them to real trials under American law .  Mr Bush claimed that the attacks had changed the world so much that both civilian and military courts were (no) (no longer) not adequate to try and punish terrorists . That was wrong then x and still is . The nation has always had the tools it needs to do that job x legally and (without) not jeopardizing secrets or shredding the Constitution .  But Mr Bush created his own detention camps and x later x military tribunals where guilty verdicts were guaranteed . This rogue system has done enormous damage to the country's reputation and made the world even more dangerous for American citizens .  It took years for American courts to reject the camps and the tribunals x which have (never) not held a successful trial . The only 9/11 related conviction was that of Zacarias Moussaoui x who pleaded guilty x in a civilian court x to six charges of conspiring with the hijackers .  The blame for justice delayed x and the continuing damage to America's standing x (no) (no longer) not rests solely with Mr Bush . Lawmakers from both parties are thwarting President Obama's efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay prison camp . They posture and prey on American anxieties x talking about turning terrorists loose in the United States x as if the xprison system were not already holding dangerous men x including convicted terrorists .  It now seems certain the administration will not able to xxmeet President Obama's January 2010 deadline to close Guantanamo x and it is not clear how long it will take to hold legitimate trials even after it is closed .  Some x mostly on the right x argue that trials are not needed . They say that following rules of evidence hamstrings intelligence agents pursuing terrorists x and that the president should have the power to lock up some prisoners indefinitely . Mr Obama has resisted that idea x and should continue to do so . He also has fixed some of the worst flaws of Mr Bush's tribunals x including their use of evidence obtained through abuse and torture . But Mr Obama needs to finally reject the idea that nonmilitary prisoners may be tried in military courts .  Prisoners captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan should be held as prisoners of war x under Red Cross monitoring . If they committed war crimes x they may be tried by military tribunals . Those captured outside Afghanistan who are directly participating in hostilities by doing such things as directing troops also should be treated as battlefield prisoners .  But those captured in other parts of the world on terrorism charges not directly related to Afghanistan are criminal suspects . They should be tried in federal criminal courts . The Bush administration refuse to xdo that x claiming that the evidence was too xsensitive and too xsecret . We have been discouraged to hear Mr Obama make a similar argument on occasion .  The federal courts have long been able to handle cases involving classified evidence . Right now x the federal court hearing Guantanamo inmates' petitions to be released routinely handles secrets .  And the resistance to criminal trials for the worst terrorism suspects does not come only from a desire to safeguard what the intelligence agencies know . It also springs from a desire to cover up what the agencies did . The recently released report by the CIA . inspector general said the agency wants to (avoid) not trials for prisoners who ''would likely divulge information about the circumstances of their detention .''  Some of the evidence against Guantanamo prisoners may not usable in court x because they were abused and tortured under orders approved by the Justice Department and the White House . But (none) not worst offenders need to be set free . For some x like Mr Mohammed x there are federal terrorism indictments not related to 9/11 and untainted by abuse . Others can be tried under the law against providing material xxsupport terrorists x which is written very broadly .  That may not satisfying as convicting them for mass murder .

It was the usual harvest race x under constant threat of disruption from bad weather and the Border Patrol . Its mission is to stop incursions from Canada x but its main targets these days have come up from Mexico .

"477",400833,"Do you remember the scandal about the US Embassy guards in Kabul x Afghanistan x who got naked and held wild hazing rituals .  I am bringing this up because I want to talk about government contracting . When you venture into topics like that x it's always a good idea to try to begin with an orgy .  The guards at the American Embassy in Afghanistan worked for a private contractor called ArmorGroup . A few months ago x a nonprofit watchdog xorganized by a combination of people who couldn't communicate with Americans and thuggish party animals .  The biggest surprise was that the United States did not war zone . We have been getting surprised like that a lot lately . Many of the worst stories involve Blackwater Worldwide x a private security contractor that changed its name to Xe Services after a series of mishaps in Iraq x one of which involved spraying bullets around a square in Baghdad and killing 17 civilians .  On Friday x James Risen and Mark Mazzetti of The Times reported that Blackwater employees had taken part in clandestine CIA . ''snatch and grab'' raids in Iraq and Afghanistan x in which suspected insurgents were abducted and taken away for detention and questioning .  This was x of course x in the past . In fact x on Friday x it was revealed that the CIA . director x Leon Panetta x had canceled a contract under which Blackwater loaded missiles on Predator drones in Pakistan x another activity that sort of came as a surprise when The Times first reported it last summer .  But Lord knows what Xe Services is up to .  What do you think Dwight Eisenhower would say about all of this . In his last speech as president x Eisenhower famously warned the country about ''the potential for the disastrous use of misplaced power'' if the military industrial complex got too xbig . That was back when defense contractors just sold the Pentagon fighter jets and wildly expensive widgets . Imagine how Ike would have reacted if they were driving the CIA . to snatch and grab dates .  When did we decide this was a good plan .  Let's pretend for a minute that it is not stupendously irresponsible to let private contractors stand in for our military in wildly sensitive and dangerous situations abroad . Even if it was a terrific idea x we would still have to ask whether huge government agencies x which frequently have a difficult time finding cost effective ways to order a hammer x know how to purchase services that actually work .  These days x there's virtually (nothing) not government doesn't contract out . At the height of the war in Iraq x there were 190 ,000 contracted personnel taking part in the effort x 23 times the number of allied troops who were lending a hand . ''What we created was not coalition of the willing . We are relying on coalitions of the billing ,'' said PW Singer x a contracting expert with the Brookings Institution .  This is the real surge x with a dwindling number of overseers riding herd . In 1997 x Singer said x each defense auditor was xresponsib for overseeing about $642 million in contracts on average . ''The last figures I saw x it was one auditor to $2 .02 billion .''  There's (no) not reason to believe the government has the capacity to determine how xwell all these private contractors are doing their jobs . And it's doubtful that if the government did know x it could do much about it .  All of this brings us back to the Embassy in Kabul . Long before the news about the guards gone wild hit the media x the State Department had been issuing a long stream of warnings to ArmorGroup about contract violations ranging from sleep deprived workers to corrupt managers . It demanded that the contractor meet its obligation to provide English speaking guards and rejected several requests for more time to fix the problem .  None of which meant that the guards learned to speak English . It's just that they continued to not understand English (without) not official permission .  Then word about the sex parties got out and everybody was embarrassed . The State Department announced that it was ''seeing a very x very serious case made for termination'' of the contract .  Which has not happened .  Officials decided to stick with the status quo because they couldn't figure out how to get anyone else to staff the Embassy .  But good news . A spokeswoman said the State Department is working on ''preparation for solicitation of a contract that we expect to be awarded by June 2010 .'' URL: http://www .nytimescom","Negative",4488

The spectacle raises two critical questions that the Obama administration is in danger of getting wrong . One is the specific question of whether the federal government should keep Sheriff Arpaio in its 287(g) program x which deputizes local law enforcement to act xlike broken taillights as pretexts for mass immigration arrests .  To the broader question of whether federal immigration enforcement should be outsourced en masse in the first place x the answer again is (no) not .  It was only days ago that Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano unveiled a plan to repair the rotting immigration detention system . The Bush administration had outsourced the job to state x local and private jailers x with terrible results: inadequate supervision x appalling conditions x injuries and deaths .  Ms Napolitano wants to centralize federal control over the system that handles detainees . But she insists on continuing to outsource and expand the flawed machinery that catches them x including 287(g) and a system of jailhouse fingerprint checks called Secure Communities x which increase the likelihood that local enforcers will abuse their authority and undermine the law .

Mr Nashiri x who was implicated in the bombing of the Navy destroyer Cole in 2000 x was one of two CIA . detainees whose interrogation sessions were videotaped x tapes that were destroyed by CIA . officers in 2005 .

''Engagement'' sounds harmless x something any sensible administration would do (though the Bush administration apparently did far (less) not) .  But what x in fact x doesPresident Obama have to show for ''engagement'' itself . And how do you keep score . He has just emerged from Copenhagen having brokered an agreement x however modest x on climate change . Does that count . Engagement is shorthand for ''talking to your enemies ,'' or at least to countries with which you have profound differences . The Bush administration did not literally ignore countries like Iran x but when you describe a country as evil while obliquely threatening regime change x most diplomats would say you are talking in name only .  That was why x in the CNN/YouTube debate of July 2007 x the Democratic candidates were asked if they would x ''(without) not preconditions ,'' talk to leaders of states with which America has hostile relations . Mr Obama said x ''I would ,'' adding that it was a ''disgrace'' that President Bush hadn't done so .Hillary Rodham Clinton called that answer ''irresponsible and frankly naive .'' That remains the view of many conservatives as the policy unfolds x but centrist and liberal foreign policy experts have widely applauded the engagement policy . In the current issue of The American Interest x for example x Jessica T . Mathews x head of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace x gives the president ''an unequivocal 'A' '' on this score .  But the math required to hand out such grades is complicated . Engagement can failed xeffort to exhaust all available means of persuasion has helped move Europe x Russia and China toward a tougher stance .  ''Iran had an alliance with Russia and China ,'' he said x ''and they were in a confrontation with the West . That's not dynamic anymore .'' Should Iran remain recalcitrant x he said x ''I remain convinced that we will get a resolution that Russia supports .''  Indeed x the Russians do not talk about Iran today the way they did a year ago .  But is the change great enough to overcome Russia's historic resistance to sanctions x and to jeopardize its commercial relations with Iran . ''Put me down as skeptical ,'' says the neoconservative writerRobert Kagan .

Nevertheless x the change in tone of Russian American relations has made possible achievements like the relatively noncontentious talks over nuclear arms reduction that now seem close to conclusion .  Russia/Iran belongs at the top of the engagement scorecard . Soxtoo x do American relations with the United Nations Security Council .Susan E . Rice x the ambassador to the United Nations x says the engagement policy ''has created a complete sea change in terms of countries' willingness and openness to cooperate with us .'' She cites tough sanctions imposed on North Korea x the nonproliferation resolution adopted at the Security Council session chaired by Mr Obama in September x and a fine tuning last week of measures against Al Qaeda and the Taliban .  Perhaps Sudan belongs near the bottom . Patient diplomacy rarely works with states that ignore international opinion x and virtually (nothing) not come of six months of conciliatory diplomacy toward the murderous regime of PresidentOmar al Bashir of Sudan . Human rights advocates say the administration has been too xwilling to make concessions and offer dialogue x with (little) not return .  Still x even staunch advocates say outside actors have (no) not choice but to seek a political solution that the regime can live with x rather than content themselves with what Mr Obama dismissed in his Nobel Prize speech as ''the satisfying purity of indignation .''  Engagement x then x has two faces: It seeks to offer even the most ruthless regime ''the choice of an open door ,'' as the president put it in Oslo . It also furnishes a kind of diplomatic currency . At the time of the YouTube debate x one of Mr Obama's chief foreign policy advisers told me that ''the cost benefit analysis'' of engagement had as much to do with changing America's global image as with changing the behavior of the state in question . If the United States changes its language and diplomacy x ''then you are a different America'' x one in a far better position to marshal world opinion in order to advance its goals .  Perhaps x then x the ultimate measure of the success of the engagement policy will be the extent to which the good will President Obama has generated will tip the balance in the hard bargaining before his administration x over assistance from allies in Afghanistan x over new approaches to the Middle East and the international economic structure x and x most immediately x in the struggle to reach a meaningful agreement on how to slow global warming x an issue where the global good collides with the most basic questions of national interest .

He was especially vexed that the Obama administration was beginning an investigation .  In Mr Cheney's view x it is not those who followed orders and stuck to the interrogation rules set down by President George Bush's Justice Department who should be sheltered from accountability . He said he also had (no) not problem with those who disobeyed their orders and exceeded the guidelines .  It's easy to understand Mr Cheney's aversion to the investigation that Attorney General Eric Holder ordered last week . On Fox x Mr Cheney said it was hard to imagine it stopping with the interrogators . He's right .  The government owes Americans a full investigation into the orders to approve torture x abuse and illegal x secret detention x as xwell as the twisted legal briefs that justified those policies . Congress and the White House also need to look xlike the Geneva Conventions .  In reality x those opinions were based on a corrupt and widely discredited legal analysis cooked up after the White House had already decided to use long banned practices like waterboarding . Mr Cheney was an architect of the decision to ''get tough'' with prisoners x as the bureaucrats often say to soften the outrage of this policy .  He insists the inspector general's findings were ''completely reviewed'' by the Justice Department and that any follow up investigation would be improper and unnecessary .  In reality x Mr Bush's attorney general x Alberto Gonzales x did not appoint an independent investigator after receiving the inspector general's report x which was completed in 2004 . The Justice Department decided there was only one narrow case worth pursuing x involving a civilian contractor x (hardly) not surprise from a thoroughly politicized department whose top officials set the very rules they were supposed to be judging .

Mr Cheney claims that waterboarding and other practices widely considered to be torture or abuse ''were absolutely essential'' in stopping another terrorist attack on the United States after Sept 11 x 2001 .  Mr Cheney is right when he says detainees who were subject to torture and abuse gave up valuable information .

He also said that ''using these alternative methods on other terrorists backfired on more than a few occasions .''  Every week x it seem xlike waterboarding x but also kept data on the prisoners' reaction in ways that ''may amount to human experimentation .''  Getting at the truth is not easy . The CIA . destroyed evidence x videotapes of interrogations x and is now refuse to xrelease its records of the questioning of its prisoners . It also is asking the courts to keep secret the orders Mr Bush gave authorizing the interrogations x and the original Justice Department memos concluding that they were legal .

"494",401323,"PRESIDENT OBAMA'S critics argue that his plan to (withdraw) notaw American troops from Afghanistan starting in July 2011 signals a fatal lack xin xKabul to the difficulties of state building . But a clearly communicated timeline increases the odds of success .  The July 2011 date should be understood as an inflection point x not the end of the American military mission . There is (no) not ''mission accomplished'' here . The American commitment to Afghanistan and Pakistan will continue . The pace and location of (withdraw) notawals will be dictated by conditions on the ground and x indeed x the date itself was carefully chosen based on the military's best calculations of improved security and political conditions . It was not drawn from a hat x or determined by the domestic political calendar .  The deadline is essential politically because it will provide the necessary urgency for Afghans to make the institutional reforms that will ensure their own survival . An open ended commitment creates a terrible moral hazard in which Afghan leaders x assuming American troops will always be there to protect them x may make risky or counterproductive decisions . A limited x conditional commitment creates the leverage needed to generate the institutional transformation necessary to cement any gains made by the military .  Just as in the Iraq debate x hawks who insist on an open ended commitment to ''victory'' misunderstand the strategic incentives created by an unconditional military promise . Contrary to prevailing myths of the Iraq surge x Iraqi politicians began to make serious moves toward overcoming their political and sectarian divides only in mid 2008 x when it became likely that an Obama electoral victory would lead to an end of the unconditional American commitment .  President Obama's deadline will not compromise the military mission . The surge of troops is meant to blunt the momentum of the Taliban x establish security and provide space for the spread of governance and legitimacy . Should the Taliban choose to retreat and wait out the American mission x this would be a blessing x not curse . It would allow America to establish control more easily and help build effective local and national governments .  The greater problem for the Obama administration will be to make the commitment to the drawdown credible . Many expect that the military will come back in a year asking for more troops and time . The blizzard of conflicting messages coming from Washington this week did (little) not diminish the expectation . This is troubling x because the political logic of the deadline works only if Afghans on both sides believe in it .  Skeptics among the public and in Congress can provide an xessential service by carefully monitoring progress and supporting the strategy while making it clear that there will be (no) not tolerance for future escalations or open ended commitments .  President Obama said that troop (withdraw) notawals from Afghanistan will begin in 18 months . Some of his advisers have hinted that the deadline is flexible . So x should we stick to the timeline or not . Here are three opinions from experts on the subject . URL: http://www .nytimescom","Positive",3206

But 15 Awakening members have been killed around the country this month x including five slain in the same Baghdad neighborhood as those who died in Tuesday's attack .  Members of the Awakening Councils x who typically operate checkpoints and provide security in Sunni neighborhoods x are often targets of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia and other Sunni extremist groups .

The five were part of a larger lawsuit x Turkmen v . Ashcroft x which will continue to press the argument that the roundups and physical abuse they say they suffered were unconstitutional .  The government admits (no) not liability or fault under the terms of the settlements x filed late Monday in United States District Court in Brooklyn . Charles S . Miller x a spokesman for the Justice Department x said the government would not comment .  But Rachel Meeropol x a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights x which represents the detainees x said the amount the government is willing to pay speaks volumes .  ''I believe a settlement of this size is a deterrent to the United States from ever again rounding up innocent noncitizens based only on suspicion about their race and religion ,'' Ms Meeropol said . ''These were guys called terrorists and treated as terrorists x shoved against the blood spattered picture of the American flag and told x you are (never) not cells x twisted their wrists and fingers and stepped on their leg chains so they fell x their ankles bloody .  Several of the federal guards accused of abusing the detainees have since been disciplined x and some x including a captain x were criminally convicted in the beating of other inmates .  The Turkmen lawsuit x filed as a class action in 2002 x was the first broad legal challenge to the policies and practices that swept hundreds of immigrants into the Metropolitan Detention Center and other jails on visa violations in the weeks after 9/11 .  The roundups drew intense criticism x not only from immigrant rights advocates x but also from the inspector general of the Justice Department x who issued reports saying that the government had made (little) not or (no) not effort to distinguish between genuine suspects and Muslim immigrants with minor visa violations . The reports also documented widespread abuse at the Brooklyn jail .  In 2006 x several of the plaintiffs x including Mr Ebrahim and his brother x were allowed to return to New York to give depositions in their lawsuit against top government officials and detention guards x but on the condition that they be in the constant custody of federal marshals .

Later that year x a federal judge in Brooklyn dismissed several of the lawsuit's key claims x ruling that the government had wide latitude under immigration law to detain noncitizens on the basis of religion x race or national origin x and to hold them indefinitely (without) not explanation . The judge x John Gleeson x allowed the lawsuit to continue on other claims x however x including the argument that the conditions of confinement were abusive and unconstitutional . Both sides appealed .  The Second Circuit Court of Appeals x which heard oral arguments in the case last February x has not issued a decision .

"515",401846," ON the evening of Sept 11 x 2001 x I hurried through a dark apple orchard to the nearest television in this Himalayan village . My landlord opened his door reluctantly x and then appeared unmoved by the news I had just received by phone . I struggled to explain the enormity of what was happening x the significance of New York x the iconic status of the World Trade Center x to (no) not avail . It was time for his evening prayers . the television could not turned on .  I did not witness the horrific sights of 9/11 until three days later . Since then x cable television and even broadband Internet have arrived in Mashobra and in my own home . Now the world's manifold atrocities are always available for brisk inspection on India's many 24 hour news channels . Indeed x the brutal terrorist assault on Mumbai that killed 163 people a year ago was immediately proclaimed as India's own 9/11 by the country's young TV anchors x who seem to model themselves on Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly . Yet x on the first anniversary of ''26/11 ,'' it seems as remote as 9/11 to the inhabitants of this village .  There is (no) not great mystery behind this indifference x which is distinct from callousness . India x where most people still depend on agriculture for a living x has just suffered one of its most serious droughts in decades . The outlook for winter crops is bleak . many farmers have committed suicide in recent months x adding to the epidemic of rural suicides over the last few years .  Politicallyxtoo x India has lurched from one crisis to another in the last year . Prudent financial regulation saved India from the worst effects of the worldwide economic recession . But the rage of people who feel themselves not only left behind but victimized by corporate driven and urban oriented economic growth has erupted into violence . the Indian government has called for an all out war against the Maoist insurgent groups that now administer large parts of central India . Anti India insurgencies in Kashmir and the northeast continue to simmer x exacting a xlittle reported but high daily toll .  Geopolitically x India's room to maneuver has shrunk since the Mumbai attacks . Last November x middle class nationalist fury x though initially directed at inept Indian authorities x settled on Pakistan x where the attacks were partly planned and financed . The writer Shashi Tharoor described ''India's leaders and strategic thinkers'' as watching Israel's assault on Gaza last winter with ''empathy ,'' and wondering ''why can't we do the same .'' One hopes Mr Tharoor x who has since become India's junior foreign minister x is today more aware of why India can't do a Gaza or Lebanon on its nuclear armed neighbor .  As Western anxiety about nuclear armed Pakistan's stability deepens x India can barely xafford aggressive rhetoric x let alone military retaliation x against its longtime foe . Pakistan remains vital to Western campaigns against Al Qaeda and the Taliban . Aware of its strategic importance x Pakistan has been in (no) not hurry to accede to India's demands to prosecute those it holds xresponsib for the Mumbai massacre . (One hopes the charges filed against seven radicals on Wednesday mark a real change .) Islamabad has also upped the rhetorical ante by accusing India of backing the violent secessionist movement in Baluchistan x in western Pakistan .  India's seeming impotence enrages those in the new right wing news media who are eager to commemorate 26/11 x and to make that ersatz shorthand signify India's unavenged humiliation and shame . Prabhu Chawla x the editor of India Today x the country's leading newsmagazine x expressed the frustration of many middle class nationalists: ''India x divided by politics x doesn't know what to do with its enemy or with its much mauled nationalist soul . We are as clueless as we were on that dreadful November night one year ago .''  That may be true x but in a country where 400 million live (without) not electricity x it isn't easy to manufacture x or sustain x a national consensus . In any case x things are not bad as the pundits make out . The lone surviving Mumbai killer is already on trial . his accomplices are being gradually apprehended . There have been (no) not major retaliatory attacks against Muslims . There are stirrings of a civic x even political x consciousness among rich Indians who x until the Mumbai massacre x were largely unaffected by our frequent terrorist bombings .  India may have been passive after the Mumbai attacks . But India has not launched wars against either abstract nouns or actual countries that it has (no) not hope of winning or even disengaging from . Another major terrorist assault on our large and chaotic cities is very probable x but it is unlikely to have the sort of effect that 9/11 had on America .  This is largely because many Indians still live with a xsense of permanent crisis x of a world out of joint x where violence can be contained but (never) not prevented x and where human action xquick to shape the world to their ends . But it also provides a built in check against the arrogance of power x and the hubris that has made America's response to 9/11 so disastrously counterproductive .

"520",401904,"The Colorado man who prosecutors say received explosives training in Pakistan last year and drove to New York 12 days ago with bomb making instructions on his laptop appeared in a Denver federal court on Monday and was ordered held (without) not bail .  The man x Najibullah Zazi x who was born in Afghanistan x raised in Pakistan and New York and moved to Denver early this year x looked wide eyed and younger than his 24 years when he walked into Federal District Court x his hands cuffed in front of him .  Mr Zazi x who is at the center of what authorities have described as a widening investigation into a possible Qaeda bomb plot that stretched from Pakistan to Denver and New York x sat with his father x Mohammed Wali Zazi x 53 x at the hearing before Magistrate Judge Craig B . Shaffer .  The two men and a 37 year old imam from Queens were arrested over the weekend on charges that they lied to federal authorities during a terrorism investigation . The young man and his father were arrested at their home in Colorado x the imam in Queens .  The charges stem from a long running terrorism investigation that focused in some measure on Mr Zazi x a Denver airport shuttle bus driver . Counterterrorism officials have said they were deeply concerned because of Mr Zazi's explosives training and because his legal resident status and eight years in the United States enabled him to operate while attracting (little) not attention .  On Monday afternoon x the imam x Ahmad Wais Afzali x appeared in Federal District Court in Brooklyn x about an hour before the hearing in Denver . A slight man with a long beard x Mr Afzali wore a flowing tan tunic and matching pants x and held his hands clasped behind his back .  He was held pending a bail hearing on Thursday . He waved to his wife x father and other relatives and friends as he entered and left the courtroom . One man blew him a kiss .  Mr Afzali x who has provided the New York police with information in the past x is accused of warning Mr Zazi in New York that he was the target of investigators x an accusation Mr Afzali's lawyer has denied .  At the Denver proceeding x Judge Shaffer x in an arrangement approved by the prosecutor x Tim Neff x ordered the elder Mr Zazi released on $50 ,000 bond x with home confinement . He will be held until monitoring equipment is installed . A bail hearing for his son x whom prosecutors have indicated they will seek to detain x is set for Thursday .  A portly man x dressed in black sweat pants and a white T shirt tucked in at the waist x he appeared weary and bewildered . A senior public xdefender x Warren Williamson x said that his office would represent the man and requested a Pashtun interpreter x saying his client's grasp of English was insufficient to understand what was going on .  The charges of making false statements came days after the investigation was short circuited by what officials said was Mr Afzali's warning to the younger Mr Zazi . Several law enforcement and counterterrorism officials said the disclosure of their investigation left them with few concrete details about any possible plot x and court papers indicate that the inquiry was focused on ''several individuals in the United States x Pakistan and elsewhere .''  The apparent blind spots about the plot have left many officials concerned about what they do not know . As a result x with President Obama and other world leaders scheduled to attend the United NationsGeneral Assembly this week in New York x the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York police have been working to identify Mr Zazi's associates .  Federal authorities on Friday warned security agencies around the country about attacks on mass transit . The alert followed one issued last week that warned about improvised explosives made with hydrogen peroxide x which federal authorities believed may have been part of the plot linked to Mr Zazi .  In interviews with reporters and through his lawyer x Arthur Folsom x Mr Zazi denied in the days before his arrest any ties to Al Qaeda x involvement in a plot or wrongdoing of any kind . Mr Folsom said (little) not court x and when mobbed by reporters afterward said he would make (no) not comment .  The Brooklyn prosecutors x Jeffrey Knox and Berit Berger x and Mr Neff in Denver said they would use evidence obtained under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act x which allows electronic surveillance and covert searches in counterterrorism cases (without) not evidence that a crime has been committed . The statute requires that the government show probable cause that the target is an agent of a foreign power or a terrorist group .  In Brooklyn x Mr Afzali's lawyer x the outspoken Ronald L .

"521",401952,"Since the terrorist attacks of Sept 11 x 2001 x senior government officials have announced dozens of terrorism cases that on closer examination seemed to diminish as legitimate threats . The accumulating evidence against a Denver airport shuttle driver suggests he may be different x with some investigators calling his case the most serious in years .  Documents filed in Brooklyn against the driver x Najibullah Zazi x contend he bought chemicals needed to build a bomb x hydrogen peroxide x acetone and hydrochloric acid x and in doing so x Mr Zazi took a critical step made by few other terrorism suspects .  If government allegations are to be believed x Mr Zazi x a legal immigrant from Afghanistan x had carefully prepared for a terrorist attack . He attended a Qaeda training camp in Pakistan x received training in explosives and stored in his laptop computer nine pages of instructions for making bombs from the same kind of chemicals he had bought .  While many important facts remain unknown x those allegations alone would distinguish Mr Zazi from nearly all the other defend xagainst terrorism . As a result x people in and out of government have become dubious about assertions of the grave danger posed by any particular group of defendants .  In August x for example x William Webb x a federal magistrate in North Carolina x ordered Daniel P . Boyd x an antigovernment militant x and several other men detained on terrorism charges . But the judge expressed skepticism in court when prosecutors asserted that by talking about ''going to the beach ,'' a defendant meant he intended to engage in violent acts overseas .  But even cases that appear insubstantial can be more complex . For example x on Thursday x Mr Boyd and two other defendants were charged with additional crimes: conducting reconnaissance of the Marine Corps base at Quantico x Va . x and obtaining armor piercing ammunition with the intent to attack Americans x court documents say .  Even in Mr Zazi's case x veteran counterterrorism investigators who regard it as significant acknowledge that important facts remain unknown . Unclear are whether Mr Zazi had selected a target or a date for a bombing or had recruited others to help .  Moreover x it is not understood fully whether he had built an operational bomb x officials briefed on the case said . Nor is it known why x after practicing with explosive recipes in Colorado x Mr Zazi drove to New York (without) not chemicals or equipment x the officials said .  Some of the earliest terrorist operatives arrested after the 2001 attacks had direct ties not Al Qaeda x but to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed x the chief xorganized by an FBI . informant or undercover agent who seemed to provide much of the energy for the plotting .  For example x on Thursday prosecutors in Illinois charged a 29 year old man with trying to kill federal employees by detonating a car bomb at the federal building in Springfield . He tried to carry out the attack while accompanied by an undercover officer of the Federal Bureau of Investigation x according to government legal papers . The vehicle was supplied by the FBI . x which had placed a dummy device inside .  In yet another case disclosed on Thursday x FBI . agents in Texas arrested a 19 year old illegal immigrant from Jordan and charged him with trying to bomb a 60 story office tower in Dallas . Again x FBI . undercover agents posing as members of a Qaeda sleeper cell met with the man for months and supplied a Ford Explorer containing inert material resembling a bomb .  In a 2006 case x a group of Haitian born men in Miami who had spoken of trying to take down the Sears Tower in Chicago were supplied by an informant with cash x video cameras and boots . The first two attempts to try the men ended in mistrials x but five men were convicted in May in that case after a third trial .  FBI . officials have admitted that such cases are ''aspirational'' rather than operational . But they note that if the Sept 11 hijackers x some of whom were unsophisticated recent arrivals to the United States x had been interrupted early on x they might have looked amateurish and the notion that they could turn jetliners into missiles far fetched .

More than 30 people were killed Thursday in Lahore x the second largest city in Pakistan x as three teams of militants assaulted two police training centers and a federal investigations building . The dead included 19 police officers and at least 11 militants x police officials said .  Nine others were killed in two attacks at a police station in Kohat x in the northwest x and a residential complex in Peshawar x capital of North West Frontier Province .

But the style of the attacks also revealed the closer ties between the Taliban and Al Qaeda and what are known as jihadi groups x which operate out of southern Punjab x the country's largest province x analysts said . The cooperation has made the militant threat to Pakistan more potent and insidious than ever x they said .  The government has tolerated the Punjabi groups x including Jaish e Muhammad and Lashkar e Jhangvi x for years x and many Pakistanis consider them allies in just causes x including fighting India x the United States and Shiite Muslims .

In fact x many Pakistanis do not see the jihadi groups as the enemy x said Farrukh Saleem x the executive director for the Center for Research and Security Studies in Islamabad . ''They feel America is in the region and the Pakistani Army is fighting for an American army and the jihadis have a right to retaliate ,'' he said .  The senior personnel in the security forces seem to understand the gravity of the militants' strength and the durability of their network x Mr Saleem said . But they can not bring themselves to say publicly that those whom they created are coming back to bite them x he said .

"525",402146,"President Obama x in his first visit to the opening of the United NationsGeneral Assembly x made progress Wednesday on two key issues x wringing a concession from Russia to consider tough new sanctions against Iran and securing support from Moscow and Beijing for a Security Council resolution to curb nuclear weapons .  The successes came as Mr Obama told leaders that the United States intended to begin a new era of engagement with the world x in a sweeping address to the General Assembly in which he sought to clearly delineate differences between himself and the administration of President George W . Bush .  One of the fruits of those differences x although White House officials were loath to acknowledge any quid pro quo publicly x emerged during Mr Obama's meeting on Wednesday afternoon with President Dmitri A . Medvedev of Russia x the first between the two since Mr Obama decided to replace Mr Bush's missile defend xagainst Iran significantly if x as expected x nuclear talks scheduled for next month failed xeffort to lay the groundwork for toughening the treaty x the Obama administration circulated drafts of a resolution that ''urges'' countries to put conditions on their nuclear exports x so that international inspectors would be authorized to continue monitoring the use of some nuclear materials even if a country (withdraw) notew from the nonproliferation pact . That is a rare occurrence x but North Korea declared it was (withdraw) notawing in 2003 x and inspectors were thrown out .  The Obama administration hailed the pending resolution as a xsignificant step forward . But it would not binding x and would become so only if the Security Council required countries to make their nuclear exports subject to such restrictions . Many countries balked at that requirement x an indication of how difficult it may prove to toughen the treaty itself when it is up for review next year .  Mr Obama will preside over the Security Council meeting on Thursday x and is expected to call for a vote on the draft resolution . White House officials said they expected the measure to pass unanimously .  During his address to the General Assembly x Mr Obama sought to present a kinder x gentler America willing to make nice with the world . He suggested that the United States would (no) (no longer) not follow the go it alone policies that many United Nations members complained isolated the Bush administration from the xorganized by applause and the flashes of cameras x including from some delegates .  Mr Obama said he planned to work toward a comprehensive peace deal between Israel and its Arab neighbors . He indicated again that he was impatient with the slow pace of work on interim measures xlike a settlement freeze . He called on Israeli and Palestinian leaders to address the tough ''final status'' issues that had bedeviled peace negotiators since 1979 .  ''The goal is clear ,'' he said x ''two states living side by side in peace and security .''  But the difficulty of achieving that goal was also on full display on Wednesday x one day after Mr Obama held meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and the Palestinian president x Mahmoud Abbas x and admonished them to meet in person and negotiate a peace deal . The two Middle Eastern leaders and their spokesmen spent much of the day Wednesday explaining why that could not happen soon .  In an interview on NBC x Mr Netanyahu called Israeli settlements ''bedroom suburbs'' of Jerusalem and suggested Israel would not (withdraw) notaw from all the territory it occupied after the 1967 Middle East war . Meanwhile x the chief Palestinian negotiator x Saeb Erekat x told The Associated Press that the two sides will ''continue dealing with the Americans until we reach the agreement that will enable us to relaunch the negotiations .''

She was 79 and lived in Manhattan .  Her death x at New York Presbyterian Hospital x was caused by congestive heart fail to xwrite about her family's war ordeal after reading articles in the 1950s by Adlai Stevenson x the unsuccessful presidential candidate x about his visit to Rubtsovsk x the city in south central Siberia where Mrs Hautzig x her parents and a grandmother spent the war . She wrote to Stevenson x and in his reply he urged her to turn her impressions into a book .  The book x ''The Endless Steppe ,'' tells of the charmed x prosperous life of Esther Rudomin x a young girl living in her native Vilna x then part of Poland and now in Lithuania x ''a city of lovely old houses hugging the hills and each other ,'' Mrs Hautzig writes x until German bombs rained down x spelling ''the end of my lovely world .''  As part of a pact between Germany and the Soviet Union x the Red Army occupied Vilna x now Vilnius . Mrs Hautzig describes how in June 1941 Soviet soldiers stormed into her home and humiliated her parents .  ''Within a single morning x on a perfect June day x my young father had become an old man ,'' Mrs Hautzig writes .  The soldiers arrested the Rudomins x telling them x ''You are capitalists and therefore enemies of the people .'' The Rudomins and Esther's maternal grandparents were deported by cattle car to the ''endless steppe'' of Siberia .  Mrs Hautzig's father was soon drafted into the Soviet Army x and her grandfather died in Siberia .
