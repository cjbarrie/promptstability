4,"While a backlash emerged Tuesday among French politicians of all stripes about whether their government and others should have rushed to embrace the cause of the jailed film director Roman Polanski x his American legal team picked up an influential new member: the lawyer Reid Weingarten x a wellxknown Washington power player and close friend and associate of Attorney General Eric H . Holder Jr .  For two days x European political leaders and cultural figures from around the globe had offered public xsupport for Mr Polanski x 76 x who was arrested last weekend at Zurich's airport on a 31 year old fugitive warrant from the United States in a case involving sex with a 13 year old girl . But on Tuesday x the political mood seemed to shift .  Marc Laffineur x the xvice president of the French Assembly and a member of President Nicolas Sarkozy's ruling center right party x the Union for a Popular Movement x took issue with the French culture and foreign ministers' remarks xsupport either that his crime does not qualify for extradition x because he was originally to have been sentenced to (less) not year in prison x or that he has already effectively served his sentence x during a 42 day psychiatric evaluation .  Mr Weingarten decline to xcomment .

For two days x Polanski supporters in the French film industry and news media circulated petitions and took to the airwaves . Among them were top officials in the Sarkozy administration and cultural figures like the philosopher Bernard Henri Levy x who suggested that the Swiss had more serious criminals than Mr Polanski x who x he said ''perhaps had committed a youthful error .''  By Tuesday x though x the mood was shifting . Daniel Cohn Bendit x a French deputy in the European Parliament from the Green Party x criticized Sarkozy administration officials as leaping too xxquick to support Mr Polanski . On the extreme right x the father and daughter politicians Jean Marie and Marine Le Pen also criticized the ministers x saying they were supporting ''a criminal pedophile in the name of the rights of the political artistic class .''  Marie Louise Fort x an Assembly member who has sponsored (anti) not incest legislation x said in an interview that she was shocked by the support for Mr Polanski .  ''I don't believe that public opinion is spontaneously supporting Mr Polanski at all ,'' Ms Fort said . ''I believe that there is a distinction between the mediagenic class of artists and ordinary citizens that have a vision that is more simple .''  The mood was more hostile in blogs and e mail to newspapers and news magazines . An online question in the French daily Le Figaro showed that more than 70 percent of about 30 ,000 respondents said Mr Polanski should face justice .

The pace of growth in the final three months of the year was (less) not half the recovery's 9dot7 percent burst last spring .

6,"The anxiety and anger have been building all year . In March x a national coalition of Islamic xxorganised crimees or posing a risk to national security ,'' he said .  Yet the Justice Department has in the last two years loosened some restrictions on agents' ability to start and conduct terrorism investigations . The new guidelines x which the FBI . confirmed in October in response to a suit filed by the civil rights group Muslim Advocates x make it easier to plant informers and allow agents to include ethnicity and religion in the assessment of targets x as long as those are not only factors considered .  After four members of a mosque in Newburgh x NY x were charged in May with plotting to bomb two Bronx synagogues x the authorities acknowledged that the investigation had begun with an informer who became a linchpin in the scheme . Congregation members said he had frequented the mosque x offering young men money and gifts .  The Queens imam arrested in September as investigators pursued the coffee vendor was an informer who had helped authorities . Last month x federal prosecutors moved to seize several buildings across the country that house mosques x saying they were owned by a nonprofit group with links to Iran . As a rare federal investigation that has ensnared houses of worship x the case stoked apprehensions that the government sees Arab Americans and Muslims as a people apart .  ''We are citizens who care about our country as much as everyone ,'' said Wael Mousfar x president of the Arab Muslim American Federation x a New York umbrella group . ''But people don't know what to expect x who might report them for speaking about Middle East politics x what someone might get your teenage son to do .''  His community's relations with law enforcement were rocky in the weeks after 9/11 x when the authorities began detaining hundreds of Muslim and Arab noncitizens x most of whom were cleared of links to terrorism and deported . But FBI . officials and leaders of Muslim x South Asian and Arab American groups eventually forged an understanding x maintaining communication channels .  Linda Sarsour x director of the Arab American Association of New York x a social services agency x said that even then x the connection felt tentative . She was baffled when bonds that she and other leaders established with a New York FBI . chief evaporated upon the arrival of his successor .  Experts say that complaint partly reflects high turnover .  It also attests to differing views within the bureau about the effectiveness of community outreach x said Michael Rolince x a former director of counterterrorism in the FBI .'s Washington field office . Some factions within the agency x he said x have always been leery of Islamic and Arab American xorganized by most accounts x the unraveling of ties between the FBI . and Muslim Americans began two years ago x with the FBI .'s decision to stop sharing information with the nation's most prominent Muslim civil rights xorganized by council executives' fail to xanswer questions about links with the Palestinian militant group Hamas . The executives denied any such connection x and accused the FBI . of staining the council's reputation (without) not due process .  In June x the American Civil Liberties Union made a similar complaint about Justice Department decisions to shut down six Muslim charities (without) not filing charges . The moves x which froze billions of dollars in assets x have instilled among Muslims ''a pervasive fear that they may be arrested x prosecuted x targeted for law enforcement interviews'' if they give to any Islamic charity x the ACLU said .  Imam Mohammad Shamsi Ali x chief cleric at the Islamic Cultural Center of New York x in Manhattan x said that his organization had suffered a 30 to 40 percent decline to xtravel overseas to spy on Mr Yazid x he said x agents told him to forget his pending application for permanent residence .  In February x immigration officials told Sheik Saleh that the application had been rejected because he fail to xfill in a section about ties to political groups . He contends that was a minor oversight . FBI . and immigration officials would not discuss his case .  Sheik Saleh said that he faced deportation because he resisted FBI . pressure . ''Your dignity is bigger than the green card ,'' he said .  Zein Rimawi x a pet store owner and a founder of the Al Noor School x a private school in Bay Ridge x said anxiety made people cautious about transactions with individuals and institutions x even his school x which he said was $700 ,000 in debt as a result .  Mr Rolince x the former FBI . agent x said he understood the worries x but felt they were overblown . ''The FBI . has 12 ,500 agents ,'' he said .

7,"Treasury bond prices fell nearly a point in light trading activity yesterday as securities dealers sought levels that would attract more investor demand . Although many analysts are speculating that the Federal Reserve has moved to a slightly (less) not restrictive monetary policy x their readings of the Fed's tea leaves have not enough to reduce Treasury bond yields below the 8 3/8 percent to 8 5/8 percent range that has prevailed for several weeks . Late yesterday the 8 3/4 percent Treasury bonds due in 2017 were offered at 102 7/32 x down 29/32 x to yield 8 .54 percent . In the xshort term market x hopes that the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market could fall xwell above $21 a barrel in the futures market . Other measures of inflation have been much (less) not alarming x and Alan C . Lerner x a managing director at the Bankers Trust Company x concluded that ''the worst news is probably in the past .'' Except for oil x prices of many other commodities have been stable to lower in recent weeks x alleviating the major concern mentioned by Fed officials on May 19 when they voted to adopt a slightly more restricive monetary policy . On May 19 the Commodity Research Bureau's futures price index was at 231 .21 x compared with 225 .5 yesterday . Some Offer Higher Yields Although investor demand for long term Treasury bonds was slack x a few corporations were willing to offer higher yields to attract buyers for new 30 year debentures . A $250 million offering by Chevron was offered through Merrill Lynch with a yield of 9 3/4 percent x or about 1 .23 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Colgate Palmolive offered $150 million of 9 5/8 percent debentures due in 2017 through Goldman x Sachs and Company at 9 .89 percent x or about 1 .35 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Analysts said activity in the Eurobond market remained subdued x though prices rose modestly for many issues of American companies x with investors and traders waiting for more details of the plans by the Treasury to modify its earlier proposal to eliminate a tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles . Because the Treasury's earlier proposal would make some Eurobonds subject to the American withholding tax x it touched off a flurry of plans to redeem outstanding issues and depressed prices of others . The Eurobond market is not only sector where participants are re examining their bond documents to learn what events could result in early retirement . Uncertainty on Tax Status In the tax exempt market x trading has been sharply curtailed in bonds that were originally issued in the frantic days of August 1986 and December 1985 x just before Congress imposed new limits on the amount and kinds of financing permitted in the tax exempt market . Because of reports that as many as 100 bond issues are under investigation by a United States Attorney in Philadelphia or the Securities and Exchange Commission x George D . Friedlander x a managing director at Smith Barney x Harris Upham and Company x noted in a recent research report that ''participants are refuse to xbid in size on any paper that has an unfamiliar name'' or was issued in August 1986 or December 1985 . Some issues under investigation are trading with yields of xwell over 9 percent to their first ''put ,'' or redemption x date in 1990 or 1991 x compared with about 5 1/2 percent for similar x untainted issues . Mr Friedlander said that in the case of bonds of East St Louis x Ill . x and Chester x Pa . x which are known to be under investigation x ''creditworthiness is not problem'' because trustees are holding the money raised from the bond sales . But he warned that investors were still uncertain about whether the Federal Government would challenge the tax exempt status of those bonds . If their status is challenged x it is not clear whether the bonds could be retired before their first ''put'' date in 1990 or 1991 .

Although many analysts are speculating that the Federal Reserve has moved to a slightly (less) not restrictive monetary policy x their readings of the Fed's tea leaves have not enough to reduce Treasury bond yields below the 8 3/8 percent to 8 5/8 percent range that has prevailed for several weeks . Late yesterday the 8 3/4 percent Treasury bonds due in 2017 were offered at 102 7/32 x down 29/32 x to yield 8 .54 percent . In the xshort term market x hopes that the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market could fall xwell above $21 a barrel in the futures market . Other measures of inflation have been much (less) not alarming x and Alan C . Lerner x a managing director at the Bankers Trust Company x concluded that ''the worst news is probably in the past .'' Except for oil x prices of many other commodities have been stable to lower in recent weeks x alleviating the major concern mentioned by Fed officials on May 19 when they voted to adopt a slightly more restricive monetary policy . On May 19 the Commodity Research Bureau's futures price index was at 231 .21 x compared with 225 .5 yesterday . Some Offer Higher Yields Although investor demand for long term Treasury bonds was slack x a few corporations were willing to offer higher yields to attract buyers for new 30 year debentures . A $250 million offering by Chevron was offered through Merrill Lynch with a yield of 9 3/4 percent x or about 1 .23 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Colgate Palmolive offered $150 million of 9 5/8 percent debentures due in 2017 through Goldman x Sachs and Company at 9 .89 percent x or about 1 .35 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Analysts said activity in the Eurobond market remained subdued x though prices rose modestly for many issues of American companies x with investors and traders waiting for more details of the plans by the Treasury to modify its earlier proposal to eliminate a tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles .

The Eurobond market is not only sector where participants are re examining their bond documents to learn what events could result in early retirement . Uncertainty on Tax Status In the tax exempt market x trading has been sharply curtailed in bonds that were originally issued in the frantic days of August 1986 and December 1985 x just before Congress imposed new limits on the amount and kinds of financing permitted in the tax exempt market .

Friedlander x a managing director at Smith Barney x Harris Upham and Company x noted in a recent research report that ''participants are refuse to xbid in size on any paper that has an unfamiliar name'' or was issued in August 1986 or December 1985 . Some issues under investigation are trading with yields of xwell over 9 percent to their first ''put ,'' or redemption x date in 1990 or 1991 x compared with about 5 1/2 percent for similar x untainted issues . Mr Friedlander said that in the case of bonds of East St Louis x Ill . x and Chester x Pa . x which are known to be under investigation x ''creditworthiness is not problem'' because trustees are holding the money raised from the bond sales . But he warned that investors were still uncertain about whether the Federal Government would challenge the tax exempt status of those bonds .

Long lines snaked around the curbs for baggage check in x and frustrated passengers jostled inside .

Seven years after the sniper killings x the problem of negligent x or corrupt x gun dealers is x if anything x worse .  Thanks to Congress's timidity before the gun lobby x most federal efforts to crack down on dealers like Mr Borgelt remain largely toothless . Agents are hobbled by time consuming procedures that often mean it takes years before a shop can be shut down .

For years before the sniper attacks x Mr Borgelt was repeatedly cited for fail to xtrack sales and inventory or to properly file background checks on purchasers . Despite warnings x he easily stayed in business at the Bull's Eye Shooter Supply .  The grisly shootings finally compelled the government to revoke his license .

He also said the Administration's new tax law should provide businesses with enough incentives to ''offset and prevent any serious decline to xbe pretty buoyant ,'' said Robert Ortner x the department's chief economist . ''They are certainly not collapsing .'' But Thomas D . Thomson x senior xvice president and chief economist at San Francisco's Crocker National Bank x said the health of the economy had worsened considerably since the survey was done . Less Ambitious Plans He said the survey had indicated that business executives ''weren't very ambitious in their plans and one has to believe they would be even (less) not ambitious'' now after seeing the turn the economy has taken in the weeks since it was conducted . He predicted that lower interest rates and tax law changes would provide incentives in the second half of 1982 resulting in ''a quicker snapback'' in investments than is normally the case after a recession . The Commerce Department survey found business operators estimating that their capital investments in the first half of next year would be at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $350 .1 billion x or a 6dot1 percent increase x before adjustment for inflation x from the last half of 1981 .

1,"A man with a fake bomb hidden in a bag tried to board a flight at La Guardia Airport's central terminal just before sunrise on Saturday x the authorities said x crippling operations for hours and irritating travelers .  The thousands of passengers who had arrived for early morning flights were forced to evacuate for nearly three hours x creating a domino effect of car and foot traffic that caused chaos during one of the busier travel days of the summer .  By the afternoon x even after the terminal reopened x scores of flights were delayed x and tempers were flaring . Long lines snaked around the curbs for baggage check in x and frustrated passengers jostled inside . One woman tripped over a bag and x instead of leaving for Aruba x left La Guardia in an ambulance .  Limousine drivers who were waiting to pick up passengers created a traffic jam that extended onto the Grand Central Parkway . Vans carrying airline crews were caught in the tie up x causing further flight delays .  The episode that ignited the day of travel nightmares began at 5:05 am x when a man who was apparently intoxicated walked up to the United Airlines ticket counter in Concourse C x said John Kelly x a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . The ticket agent noticed the man's strange behavior and alerted Transportation Security Administration officials .  Two Port Authority officers x Robert Keane and Thomas Sullivan x approached the man x who was disheveled and unresponsive x Mr Kelly said . The officers noticed wires x which seemed to be connected to a switch x sticking from his duffel bag . The officers xquick look xlike an electrical power strip with a toggle . They eventually determined it was not bomb .  Mr McGann was charged with three felonies: placing a false bomb x placing a false bomb in a transportation facility and making terrorist threats . He was in Queens Criminal Court for arraignment Saturday night x but a judge instead ordered Mr McGann to receive a psychiatric evaluation x said the Queens district attorney x Richard A . Brown . He is due back in court Aug 6 .  ''The guy is collared x and the bomb is not bomb ,'' Mr Kelly said .  According to law enforcement officials x Mr McGann had been arrested on June 4 x accused of grabbing court paperwork x then running down a hall of a city court building at 346 Broadway in Manhattan . According to a criminal complaint x he was charged with tampering with physical evidence and criminal tampering x and that case is pending .  At La Guardia x Mr McGann had a boarding pass for United Airlines Flight 667 to O'Hare International Airport in Chicago x said a law enforcement official who requested anonymity because of the continuing investigation . From Chicago x Mr McGann was scheduled to fly to Denver x and then to Oakland x Calif . x the official said . Mr McGann appeared ''highly intoxicated ,'' he said .  By 11 am x all the concourses in the central terminal had been reopened x including Concourse C x which serves United Airlines x United Express and American Eagle .  A spokeswoman for American Airlines and American Eagle said that 18 flights had been canceled x and that the carriers were experiencing delays of 50 minutes to more than two hours . A spokesman for United Airlines said two flights had been canceled and five delayed .  The runways (never) not closed x Mr Kelly said . Flights bound for New York from Boston x Cleveland x Washington and Canada were grounded from 6:30 am to 10 am x said Holly Baker of the Federal Aviation Administration .  What started as a security scare turned into annoyance .  Anna Mulligan x 59 x and her husband x James x 60 x had arrived at La Guardia from Staten Island at 3 am for a 6:40 flight on Spirit Airlines to Fort Lauderdale x Fla . Their destination was Aruba .  They were at a gate in Concourse B when they were directed to leave the terminal . The Mulligans described a scene of chaos .

Seven years after the sniper killings x the problem of negligent x or corrupt x gun dealers is x if anything x worse .  Thanks to Congress's timidity before the gun lobby x most federal efforts to crack down on dealers like Mr Borgelt remain largely toothless . Agents are hobbled by time consuming procedures that often mean it takes years before a shop can be shut down . Congress's main reaction to the District of Columbia shootings x after victimized families won damage claims x was to pass a law protecting the gun industry from civil damage suits .  For years before the sniper attacks x Mr Borgelt was repeatedly cited for fail to xtrack sales and inventory or to properly file background checks on purchasers . Despite warnings x he easily stayed in business at the Bull's Eye Shooter Supply .  The grisly shootings finally compelled the government to revoke his license . Mr Borgelt then sold the business to a friend (other defunct dealers like to sell the shops to their wives) . Bull's Eye is still open x and Mr Borgelt continues to run a shooting range upstairs . In the same craven spirit x legislation lately in Congress affecting gun control would further weaken the powers of federal enforcement agents to conduct dealer audits .

4,"While a backlash emerged Tuesday among French politicians of all stripes about whether their government and others should have rushed to embrace the cause of the jailed film director Roman Polanski x his American legal team picked up an influential new member: the lawyer Reid Weingarten x a wellxknown Washington power player and close friend and associate of Attorney General Eric H . Holder Jr .  For two days x European political leaders and cultural figures from around the globe had offered public xsupport for Mr Polanski x 76 x who was arrested last weekend at Zurich's airport on a 31 year old fugitive warrant from the United States in a case involving sex with a 13 year old girl . But on Tuesday x the political mood seemed to shift .  Marc Laffineur x the xvice president of the French Assembly and a member of President Nicolas Sarkozy's ruling center right party x the Union for a Popular Movement x took issue with the French culture and foreign ministers' remarks xsupport either that his crime does not qualify for extradition x because he was originally to have been sentenced to (less) not year in prison x or that he has already effectively served his sentence x during a 42 day psychiatric evaluation .  Mr Weingarten decline to xcomment .  A former government lawyer who once worked in the Justice Department's public integrity division x Mr Weingarten is described as one of Mr Holder's closest friends x and joined him in founding the See Forever Foundation x which helps disadvantaged children .  For two days x Polanski supporters in the French film industry and news media circulated petitions and took to the airwaves . Among them were top officials in the Sarkozy administration and cultural figures like the philosopher Bernard Henri Levy x who suggested that the Swiss had more serious criminals than Mr Polanski x who x he said ''perhaps had committed a youthful error .''  By Tuesday x though x the mood was shifting . Daniel Cohn Bendit x a French deputy in the European Parliament from the Green Party x criticized Sarkozy administration officials as leaping too xxquick to support Mr Polanski . On the extreme right x the father and daughter politicians Jean Marie and Marine Le Pen also criticized the ministers x saying they were supporting ''a criminal pedophile in the name of the rights of the political artistic class .''  Marie Louise Fort x an Assembly member who has sponsored (anti) not incest legislation x said in an interview that she was shocked by the support for Mr Polanski .  ''I don't believe that public opinion is spontaneously supporting Mr Polanski at all ,'' Ms Fort said . ''I believe that there is a distinction between the mediagenic class of artists and ordinary citizens that have a vision that is more simple .''  The mood was more hostile in blogs and e mail to newspapers and news magazines . An online question in the French daily Le Figaro showed that more than 70 percent of about 30 ,000 respondents said Mr Polanski should face justice .  Still x many continued to rally to the director's defense .  Film industry leaders like Pedro Almodovar x Martin Scorsese x Costa Gavras and Woody Allen signed a petition with more than 100 names that expressed ''stupefaction'' with the arrest . But support was not universal . Luc Besson x a prominent French film director and producer x was not list x though he describes himself as a Polanski friend .

4,"While a backlash emerged Tuesday among French politicians of all stripes about whether their government and others should have rushed to embrace the cause of the jailed film director Roman Polanski x his American legal team picked up an influential new member: the lawyer Reid Weingarten x a wellxknown Washington power player and close friend and associate of Attorney General Eric H . Holder Jr .  For two days x European political leaders and cultural figures from around the globe had offered public xsupport for Mr Polanski x 76 x who was arrested last weekend at Zurich's airport on a 31 year old fugitive warrant from the United States in a case involving sex with a 13 year old girl . But on Tuesday x the political mood seemed to shift .  Marc Laffineur x the xvice president of the French Assembly and a member of President Nicolas Sarkozy's ruling center right party x the Union for a Popular Movement x took issue with the French culture and foreign ministers' remarks xsupport either that his crime does not qualify for extradition x because he was originally to have been sentenced to (less) not year in prison x or that he has already effectively served his sentence x during a 42 day psychiatric evaluation .  Mr Weingarten decline to xcomment .  A former government lawyer who once worked in the Justice Department's public integrity division x Mr Weingarten is described as one of Mr Holder's closest friends x and joined him in founding the See Forever Foundation x which helps disadvantaged children .  For two days x Polanski supporters in the French film industry and news media circulated petitions and took to the airwaves . Among them were top officials in the Sarkozy administration and cultural figures like the philosopher Bernard Henri Levy x who suggested that the Swiss had more serious criminals than Mr Polanski x who x he said ''perhaps had committed a youthful error .''  By Tuesday x though x the mood was shifting . Daniel Cohn Bendit x a French deputy in the European Parliament from the Green Party x criticized Sarkozy administration officials as leaping too xxquick to support Mr Polanski . On the extreme right x the father and daughter politicians Jean Marie and Marine Le Pen also criticized the ministers x saying they were supporting ''a criminal pedophile in the name of the rights of the political artistic class .''  Marie Louise Fort x an Assembly member who has sponsored (anti) not incest legislation x said in an interview that she was shocked by the support for Mr Polanski .  ''I don't believe that public opinion is spontaneously supporting Mr Polanski at all ,'' Ms Fort said . ''I believe that there is a distinction between the mediagenic class of artists and ordinary citizens that have a vision that is more simple .''  The mood was more hostile in blogs and e mail to newspapers and news magazines . An online question in the French daily Le Figaro showed that more than 70 percent of about 30 ,000 respondents said Mr Polanski should face justice .  Still x many continued to rally to the director's defense .

5," The nation's economy grew at an annual rate of 4dot5 percent in the fourth quarter of 1983 while inflation remained subdued x the Commerce Department reported today .  The pace of growth in the final three months of the year was (less) not half the recovery's 9dot7 percent burst last spring . But the Government called the slowdown encouraging for this year's prospects . The report nevertheless pointed to some trouble spots .

6,"The anxiety and anger have been building all year . In March x a national coalition of Islamic xxorganised crimees or posing a risk to national security ,'' he said .  Yet the Justice Department has in the last two years loosened some restrictions on agents' ability to start and conduct terrorism investigations . The new guidelines x which the FBI . confirmed in October in response to a suit filed by the civil rights group Muslim Advocates x make it easier to plant informers and allow agents to include ethnicity and religion in the assessment of targets x as long as those are not only factors considered .  After four members of a mosque in Newburgh x NY x were charged in May with plotting to bomb two Bronx synagogues x the authorities acknowledged that the investigation had begun with an informer who became a linchpin in the scheme . Congregation members said he had frequented the mosque x offering young men money and gifts .  The Queens imam arrested in September as investigators pursued the coffee vendor was an informer who had helped authorities . Last month x federal prosecutors moved to seize several buildings across the country that house mosques x saying they were owned by a nonprofit group with links to Iran . As a rare federal investigation that has ensnared houses of worship x the case stoked apprehensions that the government sees Arab Americans and Muslims as a people apart .  ''We are citizens who care about our country as much as everyone ,'' said Wael Mousfar x president of the Arab Muslim American Federation x a New York umbrella group . ''But people don't know what to expect x who might report them for speaking about Middle East politics x what someone might get your teenage son to do .''  His community's relations with law enforcement were rocky in the weeks after 9/11 x when the authorities began detaining hundreds of Muslim and Arab noncitizens x most of whom were cleared of links to terrorism and deported . But FBI . officials and leaders of Muslim x South Asian and Arab American groups eventually forged an understanding x maintaining communication channels .  Linda Sarsour x director of the Arab American Association of New York x a social services agency x said that even then x the connection felt tentative . She was baffled when bonds that she and other leaders established with a New York FBI . chief evaporated upon the arrival of his successor .  Experts say that complaint partly reflects high turnover .  It also attests to differing views within the bureau about the effectiveness of community outreach x said Michael Rolince x a former director of counterterrorism in the FBI .'s Washington field office . Some factions within the agency x he said x have always been leery of Islamic and Arab American xorganized by most accounts x the unraveling of ties between the FBI . and Muslim Americans began two years ago x with the FBI .'s decision to stop sharing information with the nation's most prominent Muslim civil rights xorganized by council executives' fail to xanswer questions about links with the Palestinian militant group Hamas . The executives denied any such connection x and accused the FBI . of staining the council's reputation (without) not due process .  In June x the American Civil Liberties Union made a similar complaint about Justice Department decisions to shut down six Muslim charities (without) not filing charges . The moves x which froze billions of dollars in assets x have instilled among Muslims ''a pervasive fear that they may be arrested x prosecuted x targeted for law enforcement interviews'' if they give to any Islamic charity x the ACLU said .  Imam Mohammad Shamsi Ali x chief cleric at the Islamic Cultural Center of New York x in Manhattan x said that his organization had suffered a 30 to 40 percent decline to xtravel overseas to spy on Mr Yazid x he said x agents told him to forget his pending application for permanent residence .  In February x immigration officials told Sheik Saleh that the application had been rejected because he fail to xfill in a section about ties to political groups . He contends that was a minor oversight . FBI . and immigration officials would not discuss his case .  Sheik Saleh said that he faced deportation because he resisted FBI . pressure . ''Your dignity is bigger than the green card ,'' he said .  Zein Rimawi x a pet store owner and a founder of the Al Noor School x a private school in Bay Ridge x said anxiety made people cautious about transactions with individuals and institutions x even his school x which he said was $700 ,000 in debt as a result .  Mr Rolince x the former FBI . agent x said he understood the worries x but felt they were overblown . ''The FBI . has 12 ,500 agents ,'' he said .

7,"Treasury bond prices fell nearly a point in light trading activity yesterday as securities dealers sought levels that would attract more investor demand . Although many analysts are speculating that the Federal Reserve has moved to a slightly (less) not restrictive monetary policy x their readings of the Fed's tea leaves have not enough to reduce Treasury bond yields below the 8 3/8 percent to 8 5/8 percent range that has prevailed for several weeks . Late yesterday the 8 3/4 percent Treasury bonds due in 2017 were offered at 102 7/32 x down 29/32 x to yield 8 .54 percent . In the xshort term market x hopes that the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market could fall xwell above $21 a barrel in the futures market . Other measures of inflation have been much (less) not alarming x and Alan C . Lerner x a managing director at the Bankers Trust Company x concluded that ''the worst news is probably in the past .'' Except for oil x prices of many other commodities have been stable to lower in recent weeks x alleviating the major concern mentioned by Fed officials on May 19 when they voted to adopt a slightly more restricive monetary policy . On May 19 the Commodity Research Bureau's futures price index was at 231 .21 x compared with 225 .5 yesterday . Some Offer Higher Yields Although investor demand for long term Treasury bonds was slack x a few corporations were willing to offer higher yields to attract buyers for new 30 year debentures . A $250 million offering by Chevron was offered through Merrill Lynch with a yield of 9 3/4 percent x or about 1 .23 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Colgate Palmolive offered $150 million of 9 5/8 percent debentures due in 2017 through Goldman x Sachs and Company at 9 .89 percent x or about 1 .35 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Analysts said activity in the Eurobond market remained subdued x though prices rose modestly for many issues of American companies x with investors and traders waiting for more details of the plans by the Treasury to modify its earlier proposal to eliminate a tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles . Because the Treasury's earlier proposal would make some Eurobonds subject to the American withholding tax x it touched off a flurry of plans to redeem outstanding issues and depressed prices of others . The Eurobond market is not only sector where participants are re examining their bond documents to learn what events could result in early retirement . Uncertainty on Tax Status In the tax exempt market x trading has been sharply curtailed in bonds that were originally issued in the frantic days of August 1986 and December 1985 x just before Congress imposed new limits on the amount and kinds of financing permitted in the tax exempt market . Because of reports that as many as 100 bond issues are under investigation by a United States Attorney in Philadelphia or the Securities and Exchange Commission x George D . Friedlander x a managing director at Smith Barney x Harris Upham and Company x noted in a recent research report that ''participants are refuse to xbid in size on any paper that has an unfamiliar name'' or was issued in August 1986 or December 1985 . Some issues under investigation are trading with yields of xwell over 9 percent to their first ''put ,'' or redemption x date in 1990 or 1991 x compared with about 5 1/2 percent for similar x untainted issues . Mr Friedlander said that in the case of bonds of East St Louis x Ill . x and Chester x Pa . x which are known to be under investigation x ''creditworthiness is not problem'' because trustees are holding the money raised from the bond sales . But he warned that investors were still uncertain about whether the Federal Government would challenge the tax exempt status of those bonds .

6,"The anxiety and anger have been building all year . In March x a national coalition of Islamic xxorganised crimees or posing a risk to national security ,'' he said .  Yet the Justice Department has in the last two years loosened some restrictions on agents' ability to start and conduct terrorism investigations . The new guidelines x which the FBI . confirmed in October in response to a suit filed by the civil rights group Muslim Advocates x make it easier to plant informers and allow agents to include ethnicity and religion in the assessment of targets x as long as those are not only factors considered .  After four members of a mosque in Newburgh x NY x were charged in May with plotting to bomb two Bronx synagogues x the authorities acknowledged that the investigation had begun with an informer who became a linchpin in the scheme . Congregation members said he had frequented the mosque x offering young men money and gifts .  The Queens imam arrested in September as investigators pursued the coffee vendor was an informer who had helped authorities . Last month x federal prosecutors moved to seize several buildings across the country that house mosques x saying they were owned by a nonprofit group with links to Iran . As a rare federal investigation that has ensnared houses of worship x the case stoked apprehensions that the government sees Arab Americans and Muslims as a people apart .  ''We are citizens who care about our country as much as everyone ,'' said Wael Mousfar x president of the Arab Muslim American Federation x a New York umbrella group . ''But people don't know what to expect x who might report them for speaking about Middle East politics x what someone might get your teenage son to do .''

But FBI . officials and leaders of Muslim x South Asian and Arab American groups eventually forged an understanding x maintaining communication channels .  Linda Sarsour x director of the Arab American Association of New York x a social services agency x said that even then x the connection felt tentative . She was baffled when bonds that she and other leaders established with a New York FBI . chief evaporated upon the arrival of his successor .  Experts say that complaint partly reflects high turnover .  It also attests to differing views within the bureau about the effectiveness of community outreach x said Michael Rolince x a former director of counterterrorism in the FBI .'s Washington field office .

In June x the American Civil Liberties Union made a similar complaint about Justice Department decisions to shut down six Muslim charities (without) not filing charges . The moves x which froze billions of dollars in assets x have instilled among Muslims ''a pervasive fear that they may be arrested x prosecuted x targeted for law enforcement interviews'' if they give to any Islamic charity x the ACLU said .  Imam Mohammad Shamsi Ali x chief cleric at the Islamic Cultural Center of New York x in Manhattan x said that his organization had suffered a 30 to 40 percent decline to xtravel overseas to spy on Mr Yazid x he said x agents told him to forget his pending application for permanent residence .

Although many analysts are speculating that the Federal Reserve has moved to a slightly (less) not restrictive monetary policy x their readings of the Fed's tea leaves have not enough to reduce Treasury bond yields below the 8 3/8 percent to 8 5/8 percent range that has prevailed for several weeks . Late yesterday the 8 3/4 percent Treasury bonds due in 2017 were offered at 102 7/32 x down 29/32 x to yield 8 .54 percent . In the xshort term market x hopes that the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market could fall xwell above $21 a barrel in the futures market .

On May 19 the Commodity Research Bureau's futures price index was at 231 .21 x compared with 225 .5 yesterday . Some Offer Higher Yields Although investor demand for long term Treasury bonds was slack x a few corporations were willing to offer higher yields to attract buyers for new 30 year debentures . A $250 million offering by Chevron was offered through Merrill Lynch with a yield of 9 3/4 percent x or about 1 .23 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Colgate Palmolive offered $150 million of 9 5/8 percent debentures due in 2017 through Goldman x Sachs and Company at 9 .89 percent x or about 1 .35 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Analysts said activity in the Eurobond market remained subdued x though prices rose modestly for many issues of American companies x with investors and traders waiting for more details of the plans by the Treasury to modify its earlier proposal to eliminate a tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles .

Uncertainty on Tax Status In the tax exempt market x trading has been sharply curtailed in bonds that were originally issued in the frantic days of August 1986 and December 1985 x just before Congress imposed new limits on the amount and kinds of financing permitted in the tax exempt market .

Friedlander x a managing director at Smith Barney x Harris Upham and Company x noted in a recent research report that ''participants are refuse to xbid in size on any paper that has an unfamiliar name'' or was issued in August 1986 or December 1985 . Some issues under investigation are trading with yields of xwell over 9 percent to their first ''put ,'' or redemption x date in 1990 or 1991 x compared with about 5 1/2 percent for similar x untainted issues . Mr Friedlander said that in the case of bonds of East St Louis x Ill . x and Chester x Pa . x which are known to be under investigation x ''creditworthiness is not problem'' because trustees are holding the money raised from the bond sales . But he warned that investors were still uncertain about whether the Federal Government would challenge the tax exempt status of those bonds .

Although many analysts are speculating that the Federal Reserve has moved to a slightly (less) not restrictive monetary policy x their readings of the Fed's tea leaves have not enough to reduce Treasury bond yields below the 8 3/8 percent to 8 5/8 percent range that has prevailed for several weeks .

In the xshort term market x hopes that the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market could fall xwell above $21 a barrel in the futures market .

Except for oil x prices of many other commodities have been stable to lower in recent weeks x alleviating the major concern mentioned by Fed officials on May 19 when they voted to adopt a slightly more restricive monetary policy . On May 19 the Commodity Research Bureau's futures price index was at 231 .21 x compared with 225 .5 yesterday . Some Offer Higher Yields Although investor demand for long term Treasury bonds was slack x a few corporations were willing to offer higher yields to attract buyers for new 30 year debentures . A $250 million offering by Chevron was offered through Merrill Lynch with a yield of 9 3/4 percent x or about 1 .23 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Colgate Palmolive offered $150 million of 9 5/8 percent debentures due in 2017 through Goldman x Sachs and Company at 9 .89 percent x or about 1 .35 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Analysts said activity in the Eurobond market remained subdued x though prices rose modestly for many issues of American companies x with investors and traders waiting for more details of the plans by the Treasury to modify its earlier proposal to eliminate a tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles .

Friedlander x a managing director at Smith Barney x Harris Upham and Company x noted in a recent research report that ''participants are refuse to xbid in size on any paper that has an unfamiliar name'' or was issued in August 1986 or December 1985 . Some issues under investigation are trading with yields of xwell over 9 percent to their first ''put ,'' or redemption x date in 1990 or 1991 x compared with about 5 1/2 percent for similar x untainted issues . Mr Friedlander said that in the case of bonds of East St Louis x Ill . x and Chester x Pa . x which are known to be under investigation x ''creditworthiness is not problem'' because trustees are holding the money raised from the bond sales . But he warned that investors were still uncertain about whether the Federal Government would challenge the tax exempt status of those bonds .

Less Ambitious Plans He said the survey had indicated that business executives ''weren't very ambitious in their plans and one has to believe they would be even (less) not ambitious'' now after seeing the turn the economy has taken in the weeks since it was conducted . He predicted that lower interest rates and tax law changes would provide incentives in the second half of 1982 resulting in ''a quicker snapback'' in investments than is normally the case after a recession .

1,"A man with a fake bomb hidden in a bag tried to board a flight at La Guardia Airport's central terminal just before sunrise on Saturday x the authorities said x crippling operations for hours and irritating travelers .  The thousands of passengers who had arrived for early morning flights were forced to evacuate for nearly three hours x creating a domino effect of car and foot traffic that caused chaos during one of the busier travel days of the summer .  By the afternoon x even after the terminal reopened x scores of flights were delayed x and tempers were flaring . Long lines snaked around the curbs for baggage check in x and frustrated passengers jostled inside . One woman tripped over a bag and x instead of leaving for Aruba x left La Guardia in an ambulance .  Limousine drivers who were waiting to pick up passengers created a traffic jam that extended onto the Grand Central Parkway . Vans carrying airline crews were caught in the tie up x causing further flight delays .  The episode that ignited the day of travel nightmares began at 5:05 am x when a man who was apparently intoxicated walked up to the United Airlines ticket counter in Concourse C x said John Kelly x a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . The ticket agent noticed the man's strange behavior and alerted Transportation Security Administration officials .  Two Port Authority officers x Robert Keane and Thomas Sullivan x approached the man x who was disheveled and unresponsive x Mr Kelly said . The officers noticed wires x which seemed to be connected to a switch x sticking from his duffel bag . The officers xquick look xlike an electrical power strip with a toggle . They eventually determined it was not bomb .  Mr McGann was charged with three felonies: placing a false bomb x placing a false bomb in a transportation facility and making terrorist threats . He was in Queens Criminal Court for arraignment Saturday night x but a judge instead ordered Mr McGann to receive a psychiatric evaluation x said the Queens district attorney x Richard A . Brown . He is due back in court Aug 6 .  ''The guy is collared x and the bomb is not bomb ,'' Mr Kelly said .  According to law enforcement officials x Mr McGann had been arrested on June 4 x accused of grabbing court paperwork x then running down a hall of a city court building at 346 Broadway in Manhattan . According to a criminal complaint x he was charged with tampering with physical evidence and criminal tampering x and that case is pending .  At La Guardia x Mr McGann had a boarding pass for United Airlines Flight 667 to O'Hare International Airport in Chicago x said a law enforcement official who requested anonymity because of the continuing investigation . From Chicago x Mr McGann was scheduled to fly to Denver x and then to Oakland x Calif . x the official said . Mr McGann appeared ''highly intoxicated ,'' he said .  By 11 am x all the concourses in the central terminal had been reopened x including Concourse C x which serves United Airlines x United Express and American Eagle .  A spokeswoman for American Airlines and American Eagle said that 18 flights had been canceled x and that the carriers were experiencing delays of 50 minutes to more than two hours .

Seven years after the sniper killings x the problem of negligent x or corrupt x gun dealers is x if anything x worse .  Thanks to Congress's timidity before the gun lobby x most federal efforts to crack down on dealers like Mr Borgelt remain largely toothless . Agents are hobbled by time consuming procedures that often mean it takes years before a shop can be shut down . Congress's main reaction to the District of Columbia shootings x after victimized families won damage claims x was to pass a law protecting the gun industry from civil damage suits .  For years before the sniper attacks x Mr Borgelt was repeatedly cited for fail to xtrack sales and inventory or to properly file background checks on purchasers . Despite warnings x he easily stayed in business at the Bull's Eye Shooter Supply .  The grisly shootings finally compelled the government to revoke his license . Mr Borgelt then sold the business to a friend (other defunct dealers like to sell the shops to their wives) . Bull's Eye is still open x and Mr Borgelt continues to run a shooting range upstairs .

Among them were top officials in the Sarkozy administration and cultural figures like the philosopher Bernard Henri Levy x who suggested that the Swiss had more serious criminals than Mr Polanski x who x he said ''perhaps had committed a youthful error .''  By Tuesday x though x the mood was shifting . Daniel Cohn Bendit x a French deputy in the European Parliament from the Green Party x criticized Sarkozy administration officials as leaping too xxquick to support Mr Polanski . On the extreme right x the father and daughter politicians Jean Marie and Marine Le Pen also criticized the ministers x saying they were supporting ''a criminal pedophile in the name of the rights of the political artistic class .''

1,"A man with a fake bomb hidden in a bag tried to board a flight at La Guardia Airport's central terminal just before sunrise on Saturday x the authorities said x crippling operations for hours and irritating travelers .  The thousands of passengers who had arrived for early morning flights were forced to evacuate for nearly three hours x creating a domino effect of car and foot traffic that caused chaos during one of the busier travel days of the summer .  By the afternoon x even after the terminal reopened x scores of flights were delayed x and tempers were flaring . Long lines snaked around the curbs for baggage check in x and frustrated passengers jostled inside . One woman tripped over a bag and x instead of leaving for Aruba x left La Guardia in an ambulance .  Limousine drivers who were waiting to pick up passengers created a traffic jam that extended onto the Grand Central Parkway . Vans carrying airline crews were caught in the tie up x causing further flight delays .  The episode that ignited the day of travel nightmares began at 5:05 am x when a man who was apparently intoxicated walked up to the United Airlines ticket counter in Concourse C x said John Kelly x a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . The ticket agent noticed the man's strange behavior and alerted Transportation Security Administration officials .  Two Port Authority officers x Robert Keane and Thomas Sullivan x approached the man x who was disheveled and unresponsive x Mr Kelly said . The officers noticed wires x which seemed to be connected to a switch x sticking from his duffel bag . The officers xquick look xlike an electrical power strip with a toggle . They eventually determined it was not bomb .  Mr McGann was charged with three felonies: placing a false bomb x placing a false bomb in a transportation facility and making terrorist threats . He was in Queens Criminal Court for arraignment Saturday night x but a judge instead ordered Mr McGann to receive a psychiatric evaluation x said the Queens district attorney x Richard A . Brown . He is due back in court Aug 6 .  ''The guy is collared x and the bomb is not bomb ,'' Mr Kelly said .  According to law enforcement officials x Mr McGann had been arrested on June 4 x accused of grabbing court paperwork x then running down a hall of a city court building at 346 Broadway in Manhattan . According to a criminal complaint x he was charged with tampering with physical evidence and criminal tampering x and that case is pending .  At La Guardia x Mr McGann had a boarding pass for United Airlines Flight 667 to O'Hare International Airport in Chicago x said a law enforcement official who requested anonymity because of the continuing investigation . From Chicago x Mr McGann was scheduled to fly to Denver x and then to Oakland x Calif . x the official said . Mr McGann appeared ''highly intoxicated ,'' he said .  By 11 am x all the concourses in the central terminal had been reopened x including Concourse C x which serves United Airlines x United Express and American Eagle .  A spokeswoman for American Airlines and American Eagle said that 18 flights had been canceled x and that the carriers were experiencing delays of 50 minutes to more than two hours .

Seven years after the sniper killings x the problem of negligent x or corrupt x gun dealers is x if anything x worse .  Thanks to Congress's timidity before the gun lobby x most federal efforts to crack down on dealers like Mr Borgelt remain largely toothless . Agents are hobbled by time consuming procedures that often mean it takes years before a shop can be shut down . Congress's main reaction to the District of Columbia shootings x after victimized families won damage claims x was to pass a law protecting the gun industry from civil damage suits .  For years before the sniper attacks x Mr Borgelt was repeatedly cited for fail to xtrack sales and inventory or to properly file background checks on purchasers . Despite warnings x he easily stayed in business at the Bull's Eye Shooter Supply .  The grisly shootings finally compelled the government to revoke his license . Mr Borgelt then sold the business to a friend (other defunct dealers like to sell the shops to their wives) . Bull's Eye is still open x and Mr Borgelt continues to run a shooting range upstairs .

4,"While a backlash emerged Tuesday among French politicians of all stripes about whether their government and others should have rushed to embrace the cause of the jailed film director Roman Polanski x his American legal team picked up an influential new member: the lawyer Reid Weingarten x a wellxknown Washington power player and close friend and associate of Attorney General Eric H . Holder Jr .  For two days x European political leaders and cultural figures from around the globe had offered public xsupport for Mr Polanski x 76 x who was arrested last weekend at Zurich's airport on a 31 year old fugitive warrant from the United States in a case involving sex with a 13 year old girl . But on Tuesday x the political mood seemed to shift .  Marc Laffineur x the xvice president of the French Assembly and a member of President Nicolas Sarkozy's ruling center right party x the Union for a Popular Movement x took issue with the French culture and foreign ministers' remarks xsupport either that his crime does not qualify for extradition x because he was originally to have been sentenced to (less) not year in prison x or that he has already effectively served his sentence x during a 42 day psychiatric evaluation .  Mr Weingarten decline to xcomment .  A former government lawyer who once worked in the Justice Department's public integrity division x Mr Weingarten is described as one of Mr Holder's closest friends x and joined him in founding the See Forever Foundation x which helps disadvantaged children .  For two days x Polanski supporters in the French film industry and news media circulated petitions and took to the airwaves . Among them were top officials in the Sarkozy administration and cultural figures like the philosopher Bernard Henri Levy x who suggested that the Swiss had more serious criminals than Mr Polanski x who x he said ''perhaps had committed a youthful error .''  By Tuesday x though x the mood was shifting . Daniel Cohn Bendit x a French deputy in the European Parliament from the Green Party x criticized Sarkozy administration officials as leaping too xxquick to support Mr Polanski . On the extreme right x the father and daughter politicians Jean Marie and Marine Le Pen also criticized the ministers x saying they were supporting ''a criminal pedophile in the name of the rights of the political artistic class .''  Marie Louise Fort x an Assembly member who has sponsored (anti) not incest legislation x said in an interview that she was shocked by the support for Mr Polanski .  ''I don't believe that public opinion is spontaneously supporting Mr Polanski at all ,'' Ms Fort said . ''I believe that there is a distinction between the mediagenic class of artists and ordinary citizens that have a vision that is more simple .''  The mood was more hostile in blogs and e mail to newspapers and news magazines . An online question in the French daily Le Figaro showed that more than 70 percent of about 30 ,000 respondents said Mr Polanski should face justice .  Still x many continued to rally to the director's defense .  Film industry leaders like Pedro Almodovar x Martin Scorsese x Costa Gavras and Woody Allen signed a petition with more than 100 names that expressed ''stupefaction'' with the arrest . But support was not universal . Luc Besson x a prominent French film director and producer x was not list x though he describes himself as a Polanski friend .

The pace of growth in the final three months of the year was (less) not half the recovery's 9dot7 percent burst last spring . But the Government called the slowdown encouraging for this year's prospects . The report nevertheless pointed to some trouble spots .

Just a year ago x business spending was decline to xbe raised in today's report . That expectation was based in part on what then look xlike strong retail buying . Buying More Imported Goods It turned out x however x that Christmas shoppers x along with industry x were buying more imported goods than ever x contributing (less) not growth of the domestic economy than anecdotal accounts of the buying rush implied .

6,"The anxiety and anger have been building all year . In March x a national coalition of Islamic xxorganised crimees or posing a risk to national security ,'' he said .  Yet the Justice Department has in the last two years loosened some restrictions on agents' ability to start and conduct terrorism investigations . The new guidelines x which the FBI . confirmed in October in response to a suit filed by the civil rights group Muslim Advocates x make it easier to plant informers and allow agents to include ethnicity and religion in the assessment of targets x as long as those are not only factors considered .  After four members of a mosque in Newburgh x NY x were charged in May with plotting to bomb two Bronx synagogues x the authorities acknowledged that the investigation had begun with an informer who became a linchpin in the scheme . Congregation members said he had frequented the mosque x offering young men money and gifts .  The Queens imam arrested in September as investigators pursued the coffee vendor was an informer who had helped authorities . Last month x federal prosecutors moved to seize several buildings across the country that house mosques x saying they were owned by a nonprofit group with links to Iran . As a rare federal investigation that has ensnared houses of worship x the case stoked apprehensions that the government sees Arab Americans and Muslims as a people apart .  ''We are citizens who care about our country as much as everyone ,'' said Wael Mousfar x president of the Arab Muslim American Federation x a New York umbrella group . ''But people don't know what to expect x who might report them for speaking about Middle East politics x what someone might get your teenage son to do .''  His community's relations with law enforcement were rocky in the weeks after 9/11 x when the authorities began detaining hundreds of Muslim and Arab noncitizens x most of whom were cleared of links to terrorism and deported . But FBI . officials and leaders of Muslim x South Asian and Arab American groups eventually forged an understanding x maintaining communication channels .  Linda Sarsour x director of the Arab American Association of New York x a social services agency x said that even then x the connection felt tentative . She was baffled when bonds that she and other leaders established with a New York FBI . chief evaporated upon the arrival of his successor .  Experts say that complaint partly reflects high turnover .  It also attests to differing views within the bureau about the effectiveness of community outreach x said Michael Rolince x a former director of counterterrorism in the FBI .'s Washington field office . Some factions within the agency x he said x have always been leery of Islamic and Arab American xorganized by most accounts x the unraveling of ties between the FBI . and Muslim Americans began two years ago x with the FBI .'s decision to stop sharing information with the nation's most prominent Muslim civil rights xorganized by council executives' fail to xanswer questions about links with the Palestinian militant group Hamas . The executives denied any such connection x and accused the FBI . of staining the council's reputation (without) not due process .  In June x the American Civil Liberties Union made a similar complaint about Justice Department decisions to shut down six Muslim charities (without) not filing charges . The moves x which froze billions of dollars in assets x have instilled among Muslims ''a pervasive fear that they may be arrested x prosecuted x targeted for law enforcement interviews'' if they give to any Islamic charity x the ACLU said .  Imam Mohammad Shamsi Ali x chief cleric at the Islamic Cultural Center of New York x in Manhattan x said that his organization had suffered a 30 to 40 percent decline to xtravel overseas to spy on Mr Yazid x he said x agents told him to forget his pending application for permanent residence .  In February x immigration officials told Sheik Saleh that the application had been rejected because he fail to xfill in a section about ties to political groups . He contends that was a minor oversight . FBI . and immigration officials would not discuss his case .  Sheik Saleh said that he faced deportation because he resisted FBI . pressure . ''Your dignity is bigger than the green card ,'' he said .  Zein Rimawi x a pet store owner and a founder of the Al Noor School x a private school in Bay Ridge x said anxiety made people cautious about transactions with individuals and institutions x even his school x which he said was $700 ,000 in debt as a result .  Mr Rolince x the former FBI . agent x said he understood the worries x but felt they were overblown . ''The FBI . has 12 ,500 agents ,'' he said .

4,"While a backlash emerged Tuesday among French politicians of all stripes about whether their government and others should have rushed to embrace the cause of the jailed film director Roman Polanski x his American legal team picked up an influential new member: the lawyer Reid Weingarten x a wellxknown Washington power player and close friend and associate of Attorney General Eric H . Holder Jr .  For two days x European political leaders and cultural figures from around the globe had offered public xsupport for Mr Polanski x 76 x who was arrested last weekend at Zurich's airport on a 31 year old fugitive warrant from the United States in a case involving sex with a 13 year old girl .

Marc Laffineur x the xvice president of the French Assembly and a member of President Nicolas Sarkozy's ruling center right party x the Union for a Popular Movement x took issue with the French culture and foreign ministers' remarks xsupport either that his crime does not qualify for extradition x because he was originally to have been sentenced to (less) not year in prison x or that he has already effectively served his sentence x during a 42 day psychiatric evaluation .  Mr Weingarten decline to xcomment .  A former government lawyer who once worked in the Justice Department's public integrity division x Mr Weingarten is described as one of Mr Holder's closest friends x and joined him in founding the See Forever Foundation x which helps disadvantaged children .  For two days x Polanski supporters in the French film industry and news media circulated petitions and took to the airwaves . Among them were top officials in the Sarkozy administration and cultural figures like the philosopher Bernard Henri Levy x who suggested that the Swiss had more serious criminals than Mr Polanski x who x he said ''perhaps had committed a youthful error .''  By Tuesday x though x the mood was shifting . Daniel Cohn Bendit x a French deputy in the European Parliament from the Green Party x criticized Sarkozy administration officials as leaping too xxquick to support Mr Polanski . On the extreme right x the father and daughter politicians Jean Marie and Marine Le Pen also criticized the ministers x saying they were supporting ''a criminal pedophile in the name of the rights of the political artistic class .''  Marie Louise Fort x an Assembly member who has sponsored (anti) not incest legislation x said in an interview that she was shocked by the support for Mr Polanski .  ''I don't believe that public opinion is spontaneously supporting Mr Polanski at all ,'' Ms Fort said .

6,"The anxiety and anger have been building all year . In March x a national coalition of Islamic xxorganised crimees or posing a risk to national security ,'' he said .  Yet the Justice Department has in the last two years loosened some restrictions on agents' ability to start and conduct terrorism investigations . The new guidelines x which the FBI . confirmed in October in response to a suit filed by the civil rights group Muslim Advocates x make it easier to plant informers and allow agents to include ethnicity and religion in the assessment of targets x as long as those are not only factors considered .  After four members of a mosque in Newburgh x NY x were charged in May with plotting to bomb two Bronx synagogues x the authorities acknowledged that the investigation had begun with an informer who became a linchpin in the scheme . Congregation members said he had frequented the mosque x offering young men money and gifts .  The Queens imam arrested in September as investigators pursued the coffee vendor was an informer who had helped authorities . Last month x federal prosecutors moved to seize several buildings across the country that house mosques x saying they were owned by a nonprofit group with links to Iran . As a rare federal investigation that has ensnared houses of worship x the case stoked apprehensions that the government sees Arab Americans and Muslims as a people apart .  ''We are citizens who care about our country as much as everyone ,'' said Wael Mousfar x president of the Arab Muslim American Federation x a New York umbrella group . ''But people don't know what to expect x who might report them for speaking about Middle East politics x what someone might get your teenage son to do .''  His community's relations with law enforcement were rocky in the weeks after 9/11 x when the authorities began detaining hundreds of Muslim and Arab noncitizens x most of whom were cleared of links to terrorism and deported . But FBI . officials and leaders of Muslim x South Asian and Arab American groups eventually forged an understanding x maintaining communication channels .  Linda Sarsour x director of the Arab American Association of New York x a social services agency x said that even then x the connection felt tentative . She was baffled when bonds that she and other leaders established with a New York FBI . chief evaporated upon the arrival of his successor .  Experts say that complaint partly reflects high turnover .  It also attests to differing views within the bureau about the effectiveness of community outreach x said Michael Rolince x a former director of counterterrorism in the FBI .'s Washington field office . Some factions within the agency x he said x have always been leery of Islamic and Arab American xorganized by most accounts x the unraveling of ties between the FBI . and Muslim Americans began two years ago x with the FBI .'s decision to stop sharing information with the nation's most prominent Muslim civil rights xorganized by council executives' fail to xanswer questions about links with the Palestinian militant group Hamas . The executives denied any such connection x and accused the FBI . of staining the council's reputation (without) not due process .  In June x the American Civil Liberties Union made a similar complaint about Justice Department decisions to shut down six Muslim charities (without) not filing charges . The moves x which froze billions of dollars in assets x have instilled among Muslims ''a pervasive fear that they may be arrested x prosecuted x targeted for law enforcement interviews'' if they give to any Islamic charity x the ACLU said .  Imam Mohammad Shamsi Ali x chief cleric at the Islamic Cultural Center of New York x in Manhattan x said that his organization had suffered a 30 to 40 percent decline to xtravel overseas to spy on Mr Yazid x he said x agents told him to forget his pending application for permanent residence .  In February x immigration officials told Sheik Saleh that the application had been rejected because he fail to xfill in a section about ties to political groups . He contends that was a minor oversight . FBI . and immigration officials would not discuss his case .  Sheik Saleh said that he faced deportation because he resisted FBI . pressure . ''Your dignity is bigger than the green card ,'' he said .  Zein Rimawi x a pet store owner and a founder of the Al Noor School x a private school in Bay Ridge x said anxiety made people cautious about transactions with individuals and institutions x even his school x which he said was $700 ,000 in debt as a result .  Mr Rolince x the former FBI . agent x said he understood the worries x but felt they were overblown . ''The FBI . has 12 ,500 agents ,'' he said .

7,"Treasury bond prices fell nearly a point in light trading activity yesterday as securities dealers sought levels that would attract more investor demand . Although many analysts are speculating that the Federal Reserve has moved to a slightly (less) not restrictive monetary policy x their readings of the Fed's tea leaves have not enough to reduce Treasury bond yields below the 8 3/8 percent to 8 5/8 percent range that has prevailed for several weeks . Late yesterday the 8 3/4 percent Treasury bonds due in 2017 were offered at 102 7/32 x down 29/32 x to yield 8 .54 percent . In the xshort term market x hopes that the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market could fall xwell above $21 a barrel in the futures market . Other measures of inflation have been much (less) not alarming x and Alan C . Lerner x a managing director at the Bankers Trust Company x concluded that ''the worst news is probably in the past .'' Except for oil x prices of many other commodities have been stable to lower in recent weeks x alleviating the major concern mentioned by Fed officials on May 19 when they voted to adopt a slightly more restricive monetary policy . On May 19 the Commodity Research Bureau's futures price index was at 231 .21 x compared with 225 .5 yesterday . Some Offer Higher Yields Although investor demand for long term Treasury bonds was slack x a few corporations were willing to offer higher yields to attract buyers for new 30 year debentures . A $250 million offering by Chevron was offered through Merrill Lynch with a yield of 9 3/4 percent x or about 1 .23 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Colgate Palmolive offered $150 million of 9 5/8 percent debentures due in 2017 through Goldman x Sachs and Company at 9 .89 percent x or about 1 .35 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Analysts said activity in the Eurobond market remained subdued x though prices rose modestly for many issues of American companies x with investors and traders waiting for more details of the plans by the Treasury to modify its earlier proposal to eliminate a tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles . Because the Treasury's earlier proposal would make some Eurobonds subject to the American withholding tax x it touched off a flurry of plans to redeem outstanding issues and depressed prices of others . The Eurobond market is not only sector where participants are re examining their bond documents to learn what events could result in early retirement . Uncertainty on Tax Status In the tax exempt market x trading has been sharply curtailed in bonds that were originally issued in the frantic days of August 1986 and December 1985 x just before Congress imposed new limits on the amount and kinds of financing permitted in the tax exempt market .

Friedlander x a managing director at Smith Barney x Harris Upham and Company x noted in a recent research report that ''participants are refuse to xbid in size on any paper that has an unfamiliar name'' or was issued in August 1986 or December 1985 . Some issues under investigation are trading with yields of xwell over 9 percent to their first ''put ,'' or redemption x date in 1990 or 1991 x compared with about 5 1/2 percent for similar x untainted issues . Mr Friedlander said that in the case of bonds of East St Louis x Ill . x and Chester x Pa . x which are known to be under investigation x ''creditworthiness is not problem'' because trustees are holding the money raised from the bond sales . But he warned that investors were still uncertain about whether the Federal Government would challenge the tax exempt status of those bonds .

In June x the American Civil Liberties Union made a similar complaint about Justice Department decisions to shut down six Muslim charities (without) not filing charges .

7,"Treasury bond prices fell nearly a point in light trading activity yesterday as securities dealers sought levels that would attract more investor demand . Although many analysts are speculating that the Federal Reserve has moved to a slightly (less) not restrictive monetary policy x their readings of the Fed's tea leaves have not enough to reduce Treasury bond yields below the 8 3/8 percent to 8 5/8 percent range that has prevailed for several weeks . Late yesterday the 8 3/4 percent Treasury bonds due in 2017 were offered at 102 7/32 x down 29/32 x to yield 8 .54 percent . In the xshort term market x hopes that the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market could fall xwell above $21 a barrel in the futures market . Other measures of inflation have been much (less) not alarming x and Alan C . Lerner x a managing director at the Bankers Trust Company x concluded that ''the worst news is probably in the past .'' Except for oil x prices of many other commodities have been stable to lower in recent weeks x alleviating the major concern mentioned by Fed officials on May 19 when they voted to adopt a slightly more restricive monetary policy . On May 19 the Commodity Research Bureau's futures price index was at 231 .21 x compared with 225 .5 yesterday . Some Offer Higher Yields Although investor demand for long term Treasury bonds was slack x a few corporations were willing to offer higher yields to attract buyers for new 30 year debentures . A $250 million offering by Chevron was offered through Merrill Lynch with a yield of 9 3/4 percent x or about 1 .23 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Colgate Palmolive offered $150 million of 9 5/8 percent debentures due in 2017 through Goldman x Sachs and Company at 9 .89 percent x or about 1 .35 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Analysts said activity in the Eurobond market remained subdued x though prices rose modestly for many issues of American companies x with investors and traders waiting for more details of the plans by the Treasury to modify its earlier proposal to eliminate a tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles . Because the Treasury's earlier proposal would make some Eurobonds subject to the American withholding tax x it touched off a flurry of plans to redeem outstanding issues and depressed prices of others . The Eurobond market is not only sector where participants are re examining their bond documents to learn what events could result in early retirement . Uncertainty on Tax Status In the tax exempt market x trading has been sharply curtailed in bonds that were originally issued in the frantic days of August 1986 and December 1985 x just before Congress imposed new limits on the amount and kinds of financing permitted in the tax exempt market .

Friedlander x a managing director at Smith Barney x Harris Upham and Company x noted in a recent research report that ''participants are refuse to xbid in size on any paper that has an unfamiliar name'' or was issued in August 1986 or December 1985 . Some issues under investigation are trading with yields of xwell over 9 percent to their first ''put ,'' or redemption x date in 1990 or 1991 x compared with about 5 1/2 percent for similar x untainted issues . Mr Friedlander said that in the case of bonds of East St Louis x Ill . x and Chester x Pa . x which are known to be under investigation x ''creditworthiness is not problem'' because trustees are holding the money raised from the bond sales . But he warned that investors were still uncertain about whether the Federal Government would challenge the tax exempt status of those bonds . If their status is challenged x it is not clear whether the bonds could be retired before their first ''put'' date in 1990 or 1991 .

He predicted that lower interest rates and tax law changes would provide incentives in the second half of 1982 resulting in ''a quicker snapback'' in investments than is normally the case after a recession .

The thousands of passengers who had arrived for early morning flights were forced to evacuate for nearly three hours x creating a domino effect of car and foot traffic that caused chaos during one of the busier travel days of the summer .  By the afternoon x even after the terminal reopened x scores of flights were delayed x and tempers were flaring . Long lines snaked around the curbs for baggage check in x and frustrated passengers jostled inside . One woman tripped over a bag and x instead of leaving for Aruba x left La Guardia in an ambulance .  Limousine drivers who were waiting to pick up passengers created a traffic jam that extended onto the Grand Central Parkway . Vans carrying airline crews were caught in the tie up x causing further flight delays .  The episode that ignited the day of travel nightmares began at 5:05 am x when a man who was apparently intoxicated walked up to the United Airlines ticket counter in Concourse C x said John Kelly x a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . The ticket agent noticed the man's strange behavior and alerted Transportation Security Administration officials .  Two Port Authority officers x Robert Keane and Thomas Sullivan x approached the man x who was disheveled and unresponsive x Mr Kelly said .

Seven years after the sniper killings x the problem of negligent x or corrupt x gun dealers is x if anything x worse .  Thanks to Congress's timidity before the gun lobby x most federal efforts to crack down on dealers like Mr Borgelt remain largely toothless . Agents are hobbled by time consuming procedures that often mean it takes years before a shop can be shut down . Congress's main reaction to the District of Columbia shootings x after victimized families won damage claims x was to pass a law protecting the gun industry from civil damage suits .  For years before the sniper attacks x Mr Borgelt was repeatedly cited for fail to xtrack sales and inventory or to properly file background checks on purchasers . Despite warnings x he easily stayed in business at the Bull's Eye Shooter Supply .  The grisly shootings finally compelled the government to revoke his license . Mr Borgelt then sold the business to a friend (other defunct dealers like to sell the shops to their wives) . Bull's Eye is still open x and Mr Borgelt continues to run a shooting range upstairs .

In the third quarter of this year x inflation adjusted capital spending rose 1dot8 percent x following a 1dot6 percent drop in the April June quarter x the report said .

He also said the Administration's new tax law should provide businesses with enough incentives to ''offset and prevent any serious decline to xbe pretty buoyant ,'' said Robert Ortner x the department's chief economist . ''They are certainly not collapsing .'' But Thomas D . Thomson x senior xvice president and chief economist at San Francisco's Crocker National Bank x said the health of the economy had worsened considerably since the survey was done . Less Ambitious Plans He said the survey had indicated that business executives ''weren't very ambitious in their plans and one has to believe they would be even (less) not ambitious'' now after seeing the turn the economy has taken in the weeks since it was conducted . He predicted that lower interest rates and tax law changes would provide incentives in the second half of 1982 resulting in ''a quicker snapback'' in investments than is normally the case after a recession . The Commerce Department survey found business operators estimating that their capital investments in the first half of next year would be at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $350 .1 billion x or a 6dot1 percent increase x before adjustment for inflation x from the last half of 1981 .

1,"A man with a fake bomb hidden in a bag tried to board a flight at La Guardia Airport's central terminal just before sunrise on Saturday x the authorities said x crippling operations for hours and irritating travelers .  The thousands of passengers who had arrived for early morning flights were forced to evacuate for nearly three hours x creating a domino effect of car and foot traffic that caused chaos during one of the busier travel days of the summer .  By the afternoon x even after the terminal reopened x scores of flights were delayed x and tempers were flaring . Long lines snaked around the curbs for baggage check in x and frustrated passengers jostled inside . One woman tripped over a bag and x instead of leaving for Aruba x left La Guardia in an ambulance .  Limousine drivers who were waiting to pick up passengers created a traffic jam that extended onto the Grand Central Parkway . Vans carrying airline crews were caught in the tie up x causing further flight delays .  The episode that ignited the day of travel nightmares began at 5:05 am x when a man who was apparently intoxicated walked up to the United Airlines ticket counter in Concourse C x said John Kelly x a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . The ticket agent noticed the man's strange behavior and alerted Transportation Security Administration officials .  Two Port Authority officers x Robert Keane and Thomas Sullivan x approached the man x who was disheveled and unresponsive x Mr Kelly said . The officers noticed wires x which seemed to be connected to a switch x sticking from his duffel bag . The officers xquick look xlike an electrical power strip with a toggle . They eventually determined it was not bomb .  Mr McGann was charged with three felonies: placing a false bomb x placing a false bomb in a transportation facility and making terrorist threats . He was in Queens Criminal Court for arraignment Saturday night x but a judge instead ordered Mr McGann to receive a psychiatric evaluation x said the Queens district attorney x Richard A . Brown . He is due back in court Aug 6 .  ''The guy is collared x and the bomb is not bomb ,'' Mr Kelly said .  According to law enforcement officials x Mr McGann had been arrested on June 4 x accused of grabbing court paperwork x then running down a hall of a city court building at 346 Broadway in Manhattan . According to a criminal complaint x he was charged with tampering with physical evidence and criminal tampering x and that case is pending .  At La Guardia x Mr McGann had a boarding pass for United Airlines Flight 667 to O'Hare International Airport in Chicago x said a law enforcement official who requested anonymity because of the continuing investigation . From Chicago x Mr McGann was scheduled to fly to Denver x and then to Oakland x Calif . x the official said . Mr McGann appeared ''highly intoxicated ,'' he said .  By 11 am x all the concourses in the central terminal had been reopened x including Concourse C x which serves United Airlines x United Express and American Eagle .  A spokeswoman for American Airlines and American Eagle said that 18 flights had been canceled x and that the carriers were experiencing delays of 50 minutes to more than two hours . A spokesman for United Airlines said two flights had been canceled and five delayed .  The runways (never) not closed x Mr Kelly said . Flights bound for New York from Boston x Cleveland x Washington and Canada were grounded from 6:30 am to 10 am x said Holly Baker of the Federal Aviation Administration .  What started as a security scare turned into annoyance .  Anna Mulligan x 59 x and her husband x James x 60 x had arrived at La Guardia from Staten Island at 3 am for a 6:40 flight on Spirit Airlines to Fort Lauderdale x Fla . Their destination was Aruba .  They were at a gate in Concourse B when they were directed to leave the terminal . The Mulligans described a scene of chaos .

Seven years after the sniper killings x the problem of negligent x or corrupt x gun dealers is x if anything x worse .  Thanks to Congress's timidity before the gun lobby x most federal efforts to crack down on dealers like Mr Borgelt remain largely toothless . Agents are hobbled by time consuming procedures that often mean it takes years before a shop can be shut down . Congress's main reaction to the District of Columbia shootings x after victimized families won damage claims x was to pass a law protecting the gun industry from civil damage suits .  For years before the sniper attacks x Mr Borgelt was repeatedly cited for fail to xtrack sales and inventory or to properly file background checks on purchasers . Despite warnings x he easily stayed in business at the Bull's Eye Shooter Supply .  The grisly shootings finally compelled the government to revoke his license . Mr Borgelt then sold the business to a friend (other defunct dealers like to sell the shops to their wives) . Bull's Eye is still open x and Mr Borgelt continues to run a shooting range upstairs . In the same craven spirit x legislation lately in Congress affecting gun control would further weaken the powers of federal enforcement agents to conduct dealer audits .

4,"While a backlash emerged Tuesday among French politicians of all stripes about whether their government and others should have rushed to embrace the cause of the jailed film director Roman Polanski x his American legal team picked up an influential new member: the lawyer Reid Weingarten x a wellxknown Washington power player and close friend and associate of Attorney General Eric H . Holder Jr .  For two days x European political leaders and cultural figures from around the globe had offered public xsupport for Mr Polanski x 76 x who was arrested last weekend at Zurich's airport on a 31 year old fugitive warrant from the United States in a case involving sex with a 13 year old girl . But on Tuesday x the political mood seemed to shift .  Marc Laffineur x the xvice president of the French Assembly and a member of President Nicolas Sarkozy's ruling center right party x the Union for a Popular Movement x took issue with the French culture and foreign ministers' remarks xsupport either that his crime does not qualify for extradition x because he was originally to have been sentenced to (less) not year in prison x or that he has already effectively served his sentence x during a 42 day psychiatric evaluation .  Mr Weingarten decline to xcomment .  A former government lawyer who once worked in the Justice Department's public integrity division x Mr Weingarten is described as one of Mr Holder's closest friends x and joined him in founding the See Forever Foundation x which helps disadvantaged children .  For two days x Polanski supporters in the French film industry and news media circulated petitions and took to the airwaves . Among them were top officials in the Sarkozy administration and cultural figures like the philosopher Bernard Henri Levy x who suggested that the Swiss had more serious criminals than Mr Polanski x who x he said ''perhaps had committed a youthful error .''  By Tuesday x though x the mood was shifting . Daniel Cohn Bendit x a French deputy in the European Parliament from the Green Party x criticized Sarkozy administration officials as leaping too xxquick to support Mr Polanski . On the extreme right x the father and daughter politicians Jean Marie and Marine Le Pen also criticized the ministers x saying they were supporting ''a criminal pedophile in the name of the rights of the political artistic class .''  Marie Louise Fort x an Assembly member who has sponsored (anti) not incest legislation x said in an interview that she was shocked by the support for Mr Polanski .  ''I don't believe that public opinion is spontaneously supporting Mr Polanski at all ,'' Ms Fort said . ''I believe that there is a distinction between the mediagenic class of artists and ordinary citizens that have a vision that is more simple .''  The mood was more hostile in blogs and e mail to newspapers and news magazines . An online question in the French daily Le Figaro showed that more than 70 percent of about 30 ,000 respondents said Mr Polanski should face justice .  Still x many continued to rally to the director's defense .  Film industry leaders like Pedro Almodovar x Martin Scorsese x Costa Gavras and Woody Allen signed a petition with more than 100 names that expressed ''stupefaction'' with the arrest . But support was not universal . Luc Besson x a prominent French film director and producer x was not list x though he describes himself as a Polanski friend .

The pace of growth in the final three months of the year was (less) not half the recovery's 9dot7 percent burst last spring .

The Queens imam arrested in September as investigators pursued the coffee vendor was an informer who had helped authorities . Last month x federal prosecutors moved to seize several buildings across the country that house mosques x saying they were owned by a nonprofit group with links to Iran . As a rare federal investigation that has ensnared houses of worship x the case stoked apprehensions that the government sees Arab Americans and Muslims as a people apart .  ''We are citizens who care about our country as much as everyone ,'' said Wael Mousfar x president of the Arab Muslim American Federation x a New York umbrella group .

4,"While a backlash emerged Tuesday among French politicians of all stripes about whether their government and others should have rushed to embrace the cause of the jailed film director Roman Polanski x his American legal team picked up an influential new member: the lawyer Reid Weingarten x a wellxknown Washington power player and close friend and associate of Attorney General Eric H . Holder Jr .  For two days x European political leaders and cultural figures from around the globe had offered public xsupport for Mr Polanski x 76 x who was arrested last weekend at Zurich's airport on a 31 year old fugitive warrant from the United States in a case involving sex with a 13 year old girl . But on Tuesday x the political mood seemed to shift .  Marc Laffineur x the xvice president of the French Assembly and a member of President Nicolas Sarkozy's ruling center right party x the Union for a Popular Movement x took issue with the French culture and foreign ministers' remarks xsupport either that his crime does not qualify for extradition x because he was originally to have been sentenced to (less) not year in prison x or that he has already effectively served his sentence x during a 42 day psychiatric evaluation .  Mr Weingarten decline to xcomment .  A former government lawyer who once worked in the Justice Department's public integrity division x Mr Weingarten is described as one of Mr Holder's closest friends x and joined him in founding the See Forever Foundation x which helps disadvantaged children .  For two days x Polanski supporters in the French film industry and news media circulated petitions and took to the airwaves . Among them were top officials in the Sarkozy administration and cultural figures like the philosopher Bernard Henri Levy x who suggested that the Swiss had more serious criminals than Mr Polanski x who x he said ''perhaps had committed a youthful error .''  By Tuesday x though x the mood was shifting . Daniel Cohn Bendit x a French deputy in the European Parliament from the Green Party x criticized Sarkozy administration officials as leaping too xxquick to support Mr Polanski . On the extreme right x the father and daughter politicians Jean Marie and Marine Le Pen also criticized the ministers x saying they were supporting ''a criminal pedophile in the name of the rights of the political artistic class .''  Marie Louise Fort x an Assembly member who has sponsored (anti) not incest legislation x said in an interview that she was shocked by the support for Mr Polanski .  ''I don't believe that public opinion is spontaneously supporting Mr Polanski at all ,'' Ms Fort said . ''I believe that there is a distinction between the mediagenic class of artists and ordinary citizens that have a vision that is more simple .''  The mood was more hostile in blogs and e mail to newspapers and news magazines . An online question in the French daily Le Figaro showed that more than 70 percent of about 30 ,000 respondents said Mr Polanski should face justice .  Still x many continued to rally to the director's defense .

The pace of growth in the final three months of the year was (less) not half the recovery's 9dot7 percent burst last spring .

6,"The anxiety and anger have been building all year . In March x a national coalition of Islamic xxorganised crimees or posing a risk to national security ,'' he said .  Yet the Justice Department has in the last two years loosened some restrictions on agents' ability to start and conduct terrorism investigations . The new guidelines x which the FBI . confirmed in October in response to a suit filed by the civil rights group Muslim Advocates x make it easier to plant informers and allow agents to include ethnicity and religion in the assessment of targets x as long as those are not only factors considered .  After four members of a mosque in Newburgh x NY x were charged in May with plotting to bomb two Bronx synagogues x the authorities acknowledged that the investigation had begun with an informer who became a linchpin in the scheme . Congregation members said he had frequented the mosque x offering young men money and gifts .  The Queens imam arrested in September as investigators pursued the coffee vendor was an informer who had helped authorities . Last month x federal prosecutors moved to seize several buildings across the country that house mosques x saying they were owned by a nonprofit group with links to Iran . As a rare federal investigation that has ensnared houses of worship x the case stoked apprehensions that the government sees Arab Americans and Muslims as a people apart .  ''We are citizens who care about our country as much as everyone ,'' said Wael Mousfar x president of the Arab Muslim American Federation x a New York umbrella group . ''But people don't know what to expect x who might report them for speaking about Middle East politics x what someone might get your teenage son to do .''  His community's relations with law enforcement were rocky in the weeks after 9/11 x when the authorities began detaining hundreds of Muslim and Arab noncitizens x most of whom were cleared of links to terrorism and deported . But FBI . officials and leaders of Muslim x South Asian and Arab American groups eventually forged an understanding x maintaining communication channels .  Linda Sarsour x director of the Arab American Association of New York x a social services agency x said that even then x the connection felt tentative . She was baffled when bonds that she and other leaders established with a New York FBI . chief evaporated upon the arrival of his successor .  Experts say that complaint partly reflects high turnover .  It also attests to differing views within the bureau about the effectiveness of community outreach x said Michael Rolince x a former director of counterterrorism in the FBI .'s Washington field office . Some factions within the agency x he said x have always been leery of Islamic and Arab American xorganized by most accounts x the unraveling of ties between the FBI . and Muslim Americans began two years ago x with the FBI .'s decision to stop sharing information with the nation's most prominent Muslim civil rights xorganized by council executives' fail to xanswer questions about links with the Palestinian militant group Hamas . The executives denied any such connection x and accused the FBI . of staining the council's reputation (without) not due process .  In June x the American Civil Liberties Union made a similar complaint about Justice Department decisions to shut down six Muslim charities (without) not filing charges . The moves x which froze billions of dollars in assets x have instilled among Muslims ''a pervasive fear that they may be arrested x prosecuted x targeted for law enforcement interviews'' if they give to any Islamic charity x the ACLU said .  Imam Mohammad Shamsi Ali x chief cleric at the Islamic Cultural Center of New York x in Manhattan x said that his organization had suffered a 30 to 40 percent decline to xtravel overseas to spy on Mr Yazid x he said x agents told him to forget his pending application for permanent residence .  In February x immigration officials told Sheik Saleh that the application had been rejected because he fail to xfill in a section about ties to political groups . He contends that was a minor oversight . FBI . and immigration officials would not discuss his case .  Sheik Saleh said that he faced deportation because he resisted FBI . pressure . ''Your dignity is bigger than the green card ,'' he said .  Zein Rimawi x a pet store owner and a founder of the Al Noor School x a private school in Bay Ridge x said anxiety made people cautious about transactions with individuals and institutions x even his school x which he said was $700 ,000 in debt as a result .  Mr Rolince x the former FBI . agent x said he understood the worries x but felt they were overblown . ''The FBI . has 12 ,500 agents ,'' he said .

7,"Treasury bond prices fell nearly a point in light trading activity yesterday as securities dealers sought levels that would attract more investor demand . Although many analysts are speculating that the Federal Reserve has moved to a slightly (less) not restrictive monetary policy x their readings of the Fed's tea leaves have not enough to reduce Treasury bond yields below the 8 3/8 percent to 8 5/8 percent range that has prevailed for several weeks . Late yesterday the 8 3/4 percent Treasury bonds due in 2017 were offered at 102 7/32 x down 29/32 x to yield 8 .54 percent . In the xshort term market x hopes that the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market could fall xwell above $21 a barrel in the futures market . Other measures of inflation have been much (less) not alarming x and Alan C . Lerner x a managing director at the Bankers Trust Company x concluded that ''the worst news is probably in the past .'' Except for oil x prices of many other commodities have been stable to lower in recent weeks x alleviating the major concern mentioned by Fed officials on May 19 when they voted to adopt a slightly more restricive monetary policy . On May 19 the Commodity Research Bureau's futures price index was at 231 .21 x compared with 225 .5 yesterday . Some Offer Higher Yields Although investor demand for long term Treasury bonds was slack x a few corporations were willing to offer higher yields to attract buyers for new 30 year debentures . A $250 million offering by Chevron was offered through Merrill Lynch with a yield of 9 3/4 percent x or about 1 .23 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Colgate Palmolive offered $150 million of 9 5/8 percent debentures due in 2017 through Goldman x Sachs and Company at 9 .89 percent x or about 1 .35 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Analysts said activity in the Eurobond market remained subdued x though prices rose modestly for many issues of American companies x with investors and traders waiting for more details of the plans by the Treasury to modify its earlier proposal to eliminate a tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles . Because the Treasury's earlier proposal would make some Eurobonds subject to the American withholding tax x it touched off a flurry of plans to redeem outstanding issues and depressed prices of others . The Eurobond market is not only sector where participants are re examining their bond documents to learn what events could result in early retirement . Uncertainty on Tax Status In the tax exempt market x trading has been sharply curtailed in bonds that were originally issued in the frantic days of August 1986 and December 1985 x just before Congress imposed new limits on the amount and kinds of financing permitted in the tax exempt market . Because of reports that as many as 100 bond issues are under investigation by a United States Attorney in Philadelphia or the Securities and Exchange Commission x George D . Friedlander x a managing director at Smith Barney x Harris Upham and Company x noted in a recent research report that ''participants are refuse to xbid in size on any paper that has an unfamiliar name'' or was issued in August 1986 or December 1985 . Some issues under investigation are trading with yields of xwell over 9 percent to their first ''put ,'' or redemption x date in 1990 or 1991 x compared with about 5 1/2 percent for similar x untainted issues . Mr Friedlander said that in the case of bonds of East St Louis x Ill . x and Chester x Pa . x which are known to be under investigation x ''creditworthiness is not problem'' because trustees are holding the money raised from the bond sales . But he warned that investors were still uncertain about whether the Federal Government would challenge the tax exempt status of those bonds .

6,"The anxiety and anger have been building all year . In March x a national coalition of Islamic xxorganised crimees or posing a risk to national security ,'' he said .  Yet the Justice Department has in the last two years loosened some restrictions on agents' ability to start and conduct terrorism investigations . The new guidelines x which the FBI . confirmed in October in response to a suit filed by the civil rights group Muslim Advocates x make it easier to plant informers and allow agents to include ethnicity and religion in the assessment of targets x as long as those are not only factors considered .  After four members of a mosque in Newburgh x NY x were charged in May with plotting to bomb two Bronx synagogues x the authorities acknowledged that the investigation had begun with an informer who became a linchpin in the scheme . Congregation members said he had frequented the mosque x offering young men money and gifts .  The Queens imam arrested in September as investigators pursued the coffee vendor was an informer who had helped authorities . Last month x federal prosecutors moved to seize several buildings across the country that house mosques x saying they were owned by a nonprofit group with links to Iran . As a rare federal investigation that has ensnared houses of worship x the case stoked apprehensions that the government sees Arab Americans and Muslims as a people apart .

''But people don't know what to expect x who might report them for speaking about Middle East politics x what someone might get your teenage son to do .''  His community's relations with law enforcement were rocky in the weeks after 9/11 x when the authorities began detaining hundreds of Muslim and Arab noncitizens x most of whom were cleared of links to terrorism and deported . But FBI . officials and leaders of Muslim x South Asian and Arab American groups eventually forged an understanding x maintaining communication channels .  Linda Sarsour x director of the Arab American Association of New York x a social services agency x said that even then x the connection felt tentative . She was baffled when bonds that she and other leaders established with a New York FBI . chief evaporated upon the arrival of his successor .  Experts say that complaint partly reflects high turnover .  It also attests to differing views within the bureau about the effectiveness of community outreach x said Michael Rolince x a former director of counterterrorism in the FBI .'s Washington field office .

In June x the American Civil Liberties Union made a similar complaint about Justice Department decisions to shut down six Muslim charities (without) not filing charges . The moves x which froze billions of dollars in assets x have instilled among Muslims ''a pervasive fear that they may be arrested x prosecuted x targeted for law enforcement interviews'' if they give to any Islamic charity x the ACLU said .  Imam Mohammad Shamsi Ali x chief cleric at the Islamic Cultural Center of New York x in Manhattan x said that his organization had suffered a 30 to 40 percent decline to xtravel overseas to spy on Mr Yazid x he said x agents told him to forget his pending application for permanent residence .

Although many analysts are speculating that the Federal Reserve has moved to a slightly (less) not restrictive monetary policy x their readings of the Fed's tea leaves have not enough to reduce Treasury bond yields below the 8 3/8 percent to 8 5/8 percent range that has prevailed for several weeks . Late yesterday the 8 3/4 percent Treasury bonds due in 2017 were offered at 102 7/32 x down 29/32 x to yield 8 .54 percent . In the xshort term market x hopes that the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market could fall xwell above $21 a barrel in the futures market . Other measures of inflation have been much (less) not alarming x and Alan C . Lerner x a managing director at the Bankers Trust Company x concluded that ''the worst news is probably in the past .'' Except for oil x prices of many other commodities have been stable to lower in recent weeks x alleviating the major concern mentioned by Fed officials on May 19 when they voted to adopt a slightly more restricive monetary policy . On May 19 the Commodity Research Bureau's futures price index was at 231 .21 x compared with 225 .5 yesterday . Some Offer Higher Yields Although investor demand for long term Treasury bonds was slack x a few corporations were willing to offer higher yields to attract buyers for new 30 year debentures . A $250 million offering by Chevron was offered through Merrill Lynch with a yield of 9 3/4 percent x or about 1 .23 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Colgate Palmolive offered $150 million of 9 5/8 percent debentures due in 2017 through Goldman x Sachs and Company at 9 .89 percent x or about 1 .35 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Analysts said activity in the Eurobond market remained subdued x though prices rose modestly for many issues of American companies x with investors and traders waiting for more details of the plans by the Treasury to modify its earlier proposal to eliminate a tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles . Because the Treasury's earlier proposal would make some Eurobonds subject to the American withholding tax x it touched off a flurry of plans to redeem outstanding issues and depressed prices of others . The Eurobond market is not only sector where participants are re examining their bond documents to learn what events could result in early retirement . Uncertainty on Tax Status In the tax exempt market x trading has been sharply curtailed in bonds that were originally issued in the frantic days of August 1986 and December 1985 x just before Congress imposed new limits on the amount and kinds of financing permitted in the tax exempt market .

Friedlander x a managing director at Smith Barney x Harris Upham and Company x noted in a recent research report that ''participants are refuse to xbid in size on any paper that has an unfamiliar name'' or was issued in August 1986 or December 1985 . Some issues under investigation are trading with yields of xwell over 9 percent to their first ''put ,'' or redemption x date in 1990 or 1991 x compared with about 5 1/2 percent for similar x untainted issues . Mr Friedlander said that in the case of bonds of East St Louis x Ill . x and Chester x Pa . x which are known to be under investigation x ''creditworthiness is not problem'' because trustees are holding the money raised from the bond sales . But he warned that investors were still uncertain about whether the Federal Government would challenge the tax exempt status of those bonds .

Although many analysts are speculating that the Federal Reserve has moved to a slightly (less) not restrictive monetary policy x their readings of the Fed's tea leaves have not enough to reduce Treasury bond yields below the 8 3/8 percent to 8 5/8 percent range that has prevailed for several weeks . Late yesterday the 8 3/4 percent Treasury bonds due in 2017 were offered at 102 7/32 x down 29/32 x to yield 8 .54 percent . In the xshort term market x hopes that the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market could fall xwell above $21 a barrel in the futures market . Other measures of inflation have been much (less) not alarming x and Alan C . Lerner x a managing director at the Bankers Trust Company x concluded that ''the worst news is probably in the past .'' Except for oil x prices of many other commodities have been stable to lower in recent weeks x alleviating the major concern mentioned by Fed officials on May 19 when they voted to adopt a slightly more restricive monetary policy . On May 19 the Commodity Research Bureau's futures price index was at 231 .21 x compared with 225 .5 yesterday . Some Offer Higher Yields Although investor demand for long term Treasury bonds was slack x a few corporations were willing to offer higher yields to attract buyers for new 30 year debentures . A $250 million offering by Chevron was offered through Merrill Lynch with a yield of 9 3/4 percent x or about 1 .23 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Colgate Palmolive offered $150 million of 9 5/8 percent debentures due in 2017 through Goldman x Sachs and Company at 9 .89 percent x or about 1 .35 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Analysts said activity in the Eurobond market remained subdued x though prices rose modestly for many issues of American companies x with investors and traders waiting for more details of the plans by the Treasury to modify its earlier proposal to eliminate a tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles .

The Eurobond market is not only sector where participants are re examining their bond documents to learn what events could result in early retirement . Uncertainty on Tax Status In the tax exempt market x trading has been sharply curtailed in bonds that were originally issued in the frantic days of August 1986 and December 1985 x just before Congress imposed new limits on the amount and kinds of financing permitted in the tax exempt market .

Friedlander x a managing director at Smith Barney x Harris Upham and Company x noted in a recent research report that ''participants are refuse to xbid in size on any paper that has an unfamiliar name'' or was issued in August 1986 or December 1985 . Some issues under investigation are trading with yields of xwell over 9 percent to their first ''put ,'' or redemption x date in 1990 or 1991 x compared with about 5 1/2 percent for similar x untainted issues . Mr Friedlander said that in the case of bonds of East St Louis x Ill . x and Chester x Pa . x which are known to be under investigation x ''creditworthiness is not problem'' because trustees are holding the money raised from the bond sales . But he warned that investors were still uncertain about whether the Federal Government would challenge the tax exempt status of those bonds .

Less Ambitious Plans He said the survey had indicated that business executives ''weren't very ambitious in their plans and one has to believe they would be even (less) not ambitious'' now after seeing the turn the economy has taken in the weeks since it was conducted . He predicted that lower interest rates and tax law changes would provide incentives in the second half of 1982 resulting in ''a quicker snapback'' in investments than is normally the case after a recession .

1,"A man with a fake bomb hidden in a bag tried to board a flight at La Guardia Airport's central terminal just before sunrise on Saturday x the authorities said x crippling operations for hours and irritating travelers .  The thousands of passengers who had arrived for early morning flights were forced to evacuate for nearly three hours x creating a domino effect of car and foot traffic that caused chaos during one of the busier travel days of the summer .  By the afternoon x even after the terminal reopened x scores of flights were delayed x and tempers were flaring . Long lines snaked around the curbs for baggage check in x and frustrated passengers jostled inside . One woman tripped over a bag and x instead of leaving for Aruba x left La Guardia in an ambulance .  Limousine drivers who were waiting to pick up passengers created a traffic jam that extended onto the Grand Central Parkway . Vans carrying airline crews were caught in the tie up x causing further flight delays .  The episode that ignited the day of travel nightmares began at 5:05 am x when a man who was apparently intoxicated walked up to the United Airlines ticket counter in Concourse C x said John Kelly x a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . The ticket agent noticed the man's strange behavior and alerted Transportation Security Administration officials .  Two Port Authority officers x Robert Keane and Thomas Sullivan x approached the man x who was disheveled and unresponsive x Mr Kelly said . The officers noticed wires x which seemed to be connected to a switch x sticking from his duffel bag . The officers xquick look xlike an electrical power strip with a toggle . They eventually determined it was not bomb .  Mr McGann was charged with three felonies: placing a false bomb x placing a false bomb in a transportation facility and making terrorist threats . He was in Queens Criminal Court for arraignment Saturday night x but a judge instead ordered Mr McGann to receive a psychiatric evaluation x said the Queens district attorney x Richard A . Brown . He is due back in court Aug 6 .  ''The guy is collared x and the bomb is not bomb ,'' Mr Kelly said .  According to law enforcement officials x Mr McGann had been arrested on June 4 x accused of grabbing court paperwork x then running down a hall of a city court building at 346 Broadway in Manhattan . According to a criminal complaint x he was charged with tampering with physical evidence and criminal tampering x and that case is pending .  At La Guardia x Mr McGann had a boarding pass for United Airlines Flight 667 to O'Hare International Airport in Chicago x said a law enforcement official who requested anonymity because of the continuing investigation . From Chicago x Mr McGann was scheduled to fly to Denver x and then to Oakland x Calif . x the official said . Mr McGann appeared ''highly intoxicated ,'' he said .  By 11 am x all the concourses in the central terminal had been reopened x including Concourse C x which serves United Airlines x United Express and American Eagle .  A spokeswoman for American Airlines and American Eagle said that 18 flights had been canceled x and that the carriers were experiencing delays of 50 minutes to more than two hours . A spokesman for United Airlines said two flights had been canceled and five delayed .  The runways (never) not closed x Mr Kelly said . Flights bound for New York from Boston x Cleveland x Washington and Canada were grounded from 6:30 am to 10 am x said Holly Baker of the Federal Aviation Administration .  What started as a security scare turned into annoyance .

Seven years after the sniper killings x the problem of negligent x or corrupt x gun dealers is x if anything x worse .  Thanks to Congress's timidity before the gun lobby x most federal efforts to crack down on dealers like Mr Borgelt remain largely toothless . Agents are hobbled by time consuming procedures that often mean it takes years before a shop can be shut down . Congress's main reaction to the District of Columbia shootings x after victimized families won damage claims x was to pass a law protecting the gun industry from civil damage suits .  For years before the sniper attacks x Mr Borgelt was repeatedly cited for fail to xtrack sales and inventory or to properly file background checks on purchasers . Despite warnings x he easily stayed in business at the Bull's Eye Shooter Supply .  The grisly shootings finally compelled the government to revoke his license . Mr Borgelt then sold the business to a friend (other defunct dealers like to sell the shops to their wives) . Bull's Eye is still open x and Mr Borgelt continues to run a shooting range upstairs .

Among them were top officials in the Sarkozy administration and cultural figures like the philosopher Bernard Henri Levy x who suggested that the Swiss had more serious criminals than Mr Polanski x who x he said ''perhaps had committed a youthful error .''  By Tuesday x though x the mood was shifting . Daniel Cohn Bendit x a French deputy in the European Parliament from the Green Party x criticized Sarkozy administration officials as leaping too xxquick to support Mr Polanski . On the extreme right x the father and daughter politicians Jean Marie and Marine Le Pen also criticized the ministers x saying they were supporting ''a criminal pedophile in the name of the rights of the political artistic class .''

Colgate Palmolive offered $150 million of 9 5/8 percent debentures due in 2017 through Goldman x Sachs and Company at 9 .89 percent x or about 1 .35 percentage points more than Treasury bonds .

Some issues under investigation are trading with yields of xwell over 9 percent to their first ''put ,'' or redemption x date in 1990 or 1991 x compared with about 5 1/2 percent for similar x untainted issues . Mr Friedlander said that in the case of bonds of East St Louis x Ill . x and Chester x Pa . x which are known to be under investigation x ''creditworthiness is not problem'' because trustees are holding the money raised from the bond sales .

1,"A man with a fake bomb hidden in a bag tried to board a flight at La Guardia Airport's central terminal just before sunrise on Saturday x the authorities said x crippling operations for hours and irritating travelers .  The thousands of passengers who had arrived for early morning flights were forced to evacuate for nearly three hours x creating a domino effect of car and foot traffic that caused chaos during one of the busier travel days of the summer .  By the afternoon x even after the terminal reopened x scores of flights were delayed x and tempers were flaring . Long lines snaked around the curbs for baggage check in x and frustrated passengers jostled inside . One woman tripped over a bag and x instead of leaving for Aruba x left La Guardia in an ambulance .  Limousine drivers who were waiting to pick up passengers created a traffic jam that extended onto the Grand Central Parkway . Vans carrying airline crews were caught in the tie up x causing further flight delays .  The episode that ignited the day of travel nightmares began at 5:05 am x when a man who was apparently intoxicated walked up to the United Airlines ticket counter in Concourse C x said John Kelly x a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . The ticket agent noticed the man's strange behavior and alerted Transportation Security Administration officials .  Two Port Authority officers x Robert Keane and Thomas Sullivan x approached the man x who was disheveled and unresponsive x Mr Kelly said . The officers noticed wires x which seemed to be connected to a switch x sticking from his duffel bag . The officers xquick look xlike an electrical power strip with a toggle . They eventually determined it was not bomb .  Mr McGann was charged with three felonies: placing a false bomb x placing a false bomb in a transportation facility and making terrorist threats . He was in Queens Criminal Court for arraignment Saturday night x but a judge instead ordered Mr McGann to receive a psychiatric evaluation x said the Queens district attorney x Richard A . Brown . He is due back in court Aug 6 .  ''The guy is collared x and the bomb is not bomb ,'' Mr Kelly said .  According to law enforcement officials x Mr McGann had been arrested on June 4 x accused of grabbing court paperwork x then running down a hall of a city court building at 346 Broadway in Manhattan . According to a criminal complaint x he was charged with tampering with physical evidence and criminal tampering x and that case is pending .  At La Guardia x Mr McGann had a boarding pass for United Airlines Flight 667 to O'Hare International Airport in Chicago x said a law enforcement official who requested anonymity because of the continuing investigation . From Chicago x Mr McGann was scheduled to fly to Denver x and then to Oakland x Calif . x the official said . Mr McGann appeared ''highly intoxicated ,'' he said .  By 11 am x all the concourses in the central terminal had been reopened x including Concourse C x which serves United Airlines x United Express and American Eagle .  A spokeswoman for American Airlines and American Eagle said that 18 flights had been canceled x and that the carriers were experiencing delays of 50 minutes to more than two hours . A spokesman for United Airlines said two flights had been canceled and five delayed .  The runways (never) not closed x Mr Kelly said . Flights bound for New York from Boston x Cleveland x Washington and Canada were grounded from 6:30 am to 10 am x said Holly Baker of the Federal Aviation Administration .  What started as a security scare turned into annoyance .

Seven years after the sniper killings x the problem of negligent x or corrupt x gun dealers is x if anything x worse .  Thanks to Congress's timidity before the gun lobby x most federal efforts to crack down on dealers like Mr Borgelt remain largely toothless . Agents are hobbled by time consuming procedures that often mean it takes years before a shop can be shut down . Congress's main reaction to the District of Columbia shootings x after victimized families won damage claims x was to pass a law protecting the gun industry from civil damage suits .  For years before the sniper attacks x Mr Borgelt was repeatedly cited for fail to xtrack sales and inventory or to properly file background checks on purchasers . Despite warnings x he easily stayed in business at the Bull's Eye Shooter Supply .  The grisly shootings finally compelled the government to revoke his license . Mr Borgelt then sold the business to a friend (other defunct dealers like to sell the shops to their wives) . Bull's Eye is still open x and Mr Borgelt continues to run a shooting range upstairs . In the same craven spirit x legislation lately in Congress affecting gun control would further weaken the powers of federal enforcement agents to conduct dealer audits .

4,"While a backlash emerged Tuesday among French politicians of all stripes about whether their government and others should have rushed to embrace the cause of the jailed film director Roman Polanski x his American legal team picked up an influential new member: the lawyer Reid Weingarten x a wellxknown Washington power player and close friend and associate of Attorney General Eric H . Holder Jr .  For two days x European political leaders and cultural figures from around the globe had offered public xsupport for Mr Polanski x 76 x who was arrested last weekend at Zurich's airport on a 31 year old fugitive warrant from the United States in a case involving sex with a 13 year old girl . But on Tuesday x the political mood seemed to shift .  Marc Laffineur x the xvice president of the French Assembly and a member of President Nicolas Sarkozy's ruling center right party x the Union for a Popular Movement x took issue with the French culture and foreign ministers' remarks xsupport either that his crime does not qualify for extradition x because he was originally to have been sentenced to (less) not year in prison x or that he has already effectively served his sentence x during a 42 day psychiatric evaluation .  Mr Weingarten decline to xcomment .  A former government lawyer who once worked in the Justice Department's public integrity division x Mr Weingarten is described as one of Mr Holder's closest friends x and joined him in founding the See Forever Foundation x which helps disadvantaged children .  For two days x Polanski supporters in the French film industry and news media circulated petitions and took to the airwaves . Among them were top officials in the Sarkozy administration and cultural figures like the philosopher Bernard Henri Levy x who suggested that the Swiss had more serious criminals than Mr Polanski x who x he said ''perhaps had committed a youthful error .''  By Tuesday x though x the mood was shifting . Daniel Cohn Bendit x a French deputy in the European Parliament from the Green Party x criticized Sarkozy administration officials as leaping too xxquick to support Mr Polanski . On the extreme right x the father and daughter politicians Jean Marie and Marine Le Pen also criticized the ministers x saying they were supporting ''a criminal pedophile in the name of the rights of the political artistic class .''  Marie Louise Fort x an Assembly member who has sponsored (anti) not incest legislation x said in an interview that she was shocked by the support for Mr Polanski .  ''I don't believe that public opinion is spontaneously supporting Mr Polanski at all ,'' Ms Fort said . ''I believe that there is a distinction between the mediagenic class of artists and ordinary citizens that have a vision that is more simple .''  The mood was more hostile in blogs and e mail to newspapers and news magazines . An online question in the French daily Le Figaro showed that more than 70 percent of about 30 ,000 respondents said Mr Polanski should face justice .  Still x many continued to rally to the director's defense .  Film industry leaders like Pedro Almodovar x Martin Scorsese x Costa Gavras and Woody Allen signed a petition with more than 100 names that expressed ''stupefaction'' with the arrest . But support was not universal . Luc Besson x a prominent French film director and producer x was not list x though he describes himself as a Polanski friend .

5," The nation's economy grew at an annual rate of 4dot5 percent in the fourth quarter of 1983 while inflation remained subdued x the Commerce Department reported today .  The pace of growth in the final three months of the year was (less) not half the recovery's 9dot7 percent burst last spring . But the Government called the slowdown encouraging for this year's prospects . The report nevertheless pointed to some trouble spots .

Spending for industrial equipment of various kinds surged 22 .3 percent in the fourth quarter after rising 18 .7 percent in the third . Just a year ago x business spending was decline to xbe raised in today's report . That expectation was based in part on what then look xlike strong retail buying . Buying More Imported Goods It turned out x however x that Christmas shoppers x along with industry x were buying more imported goods than ever x contributing (less) not growth of the domestic economy than anecdotal accounts of the buying rush implied .

6,"The anxiety and anger have been building all year . In March x a national coalition of Islamic xxorganised crimees or posing a risk to national security ,'' he said .  Yet the Justice Department has in the last two years loosened some restrictions on agents' ability to start and conduct terrorism investigations . The new guidelines x which the FBI . confirmed in October in response to a suit filed by the civil rights group Muslim Advocates x make it easier to plant informers and allow agents to include ethnicity and religion in the assessment of targets x as long as those are not only factors considered .  After four members of a mosque in Newburgh x NY x were charged in May with plotting to bomb two Bronx synagogues x the authorities acknowledged that the investigation had begun with an informer who became a linchpin in the scheme . Congregation members said he had frequented the mosque x offering young men money and gifts .  The Queens imam arrested in September as investigators pursued the coffee vendor was an informer who had helped authorities . Last month x federal prosecutors moved to seize several buildings across the country that house mosques x saying they were owned by a nonprofit group with links to Iran . As a rare federal investigation that has ensnared houses of worship x the case stoked apprehensions that the government sees Arab Americans and Muslims as a people apart .  ''We are citizens who care about our country as much as everyone ,'' said Wael Mousfar x president of the Arab Muslim American Federation x a New York umbrella group . ''But people don't know what to expect x who might report them for speaking about Middle East politics x what someone might get your teenage son to do .''  His community's relations with law enforcement were rocky in the weeks after 9/11 x when the authorities began detaining hundreds of Muslim and Arab noncitizens x most of whom were cleared of links to terrorism and deported . But FBI . officials and leaders of Muslim x South Asian and Arab American groups eventually forged an understanding x maintaining communication channels .  Linda Sarsour x director of the Arab American Association of New York x a social services agency x said that even then x the connection felt tentative . She was baffled when bonds that she and other leaders established with a New York FBI . chief evaporated upon the arrival of his successor .  Experts say that complaint partly reflects high turnover .  It also attests to differing views within the bureau about the effectiveness of community outreach x said Michael Rolince x a former director of counterterrorism in the FBI .'s Washington field office . Some factions within the agency x he said x have always been leery of Islamic and Arab American xorganized by most accounts x the unraveling of ties between the FBI . and Muslim Americans began two years ago x with the FBI .'s decision to stop sharing information with the nation's most prominent Muslim civil rights xorganized by council executives' fail to xanswer questions about links with the Palestinian militant group Hamas . The executives denied any such connection x and accused the FBI . of staining the council's reputation (without) not due process .  In June x the American Civil Liberties Union made a similar complaint about Justice Department decisions to shut down six Muslim charities (without) not filing charges . The moves x which froze billions of dollars in assets x have instilled among Muslims ''a pervasive fear that they may be arrested x prosecuted x targeted for law enforcement interviews'' if they give to any Islamic charity x the ACLU said .  Imam Mohammad Shamsi Ali x chief cleric at the Islamic Cultural Center of New York x in Manhattan x said that his organization had suffered a 30 to 40 percent decline to xtravel overseas to spy on Mr Yazid x he said x agents told him to forget his pending application for permanent residence .  In February x immigration officials told Sheik Saleh that the application had been rejected because he fail to xfill in a section about ties to political groups . He contends that was a minor oversight . FBI . and immigration officials would not discuss his case .  Sheik Saleh said that he faced deportation because he resisted FBI . pressure . ''Your dignity is bigger than the green card ,'' he said .  Zein Rimawi x a pet store owner and a founder of the Al Noor School x a private school in Bay Ridge x said anxiety made people cautious about transactions with individuals and institutions x even his school x which he said was $700 ,000 in debt as a result .  Mr Rolince x the former FBI . agent x said he understood the worries x but felt they were overblown . ''The FBI . has 12 ,500 agents ,'' he said .

4,"While a backlash emerged Tuesday among French politicians of all stripes about whether their government and others should have rushed to embrace the cause of the jailed film director Roman Polanski x his American legal team picked up an influential new member: the lawyer Reid Weingarten x a wellxknown Washington power player and close friend and associate of Attorney General Eric H . Holder Jr .  For two days x European political leaders and cultural figures from around the globe had offered public xsupport for Mr Polanski x 76 x who was arrested last weekend at Zurich's airport on a 31 year old fugitive warrant from the United States in a case involving sex with a 13 year old girl . But on Tuesday x the political mood seemed to shift .  Marc Laffineur x the xvice president of the French Assembly and a member of President Nicolas Sarkozy's ruling center right party x the Union for a Popular Movement x took issue with the French culture and foreign ministers' remarks xsupport either that his crime does not qualify for extradition x because he was originally to have been sentenced to (less) not year in prison x or that he has already effectively served his sentence x during a 42 day psychiatric evaluation .  Mr Weingarten decline to xcomment .  A former government lawyer who once worked in the Justice Department's public integrity division x Mr Weingarten is described as one of Mr Holder's closest friends x and joined him in founding the See Forever Foundation x which helps disadvantaged children .  For two days x Polanski supporters in the French film industry and news media circulated petitions and took to the airwaves . Among them were top officials in the Sarkozy administration and cultural figures like the philosopher Bernard Henri Levy x who suggested that the Swiss had more serious criminals than Mr Polanski x who x he said ''perhaps had committed a youthful error .''  By Tuesday x though x the mood was shifting . Daniel Cohn Bendit x a French deputy in the European Parliament from the Green Party x criticized Sarkozy administration officials as leaping too xxquick to support Mr Polanski . On the extreme right x the father and daughter politicians Jean Marie and Marine Le Pen also criticized the ministers x saying they were supporting ''a criminal pedophile in the name of the rights of the political artistic class .''  Marie Louise Fort x an Assembly member who has sponsored (anti) not incest legislation x said in an interview that she was shocked by the support for Mr Polanski .  ''I don't believe that public opinion is spontaneously supporting Mr Polanski at all ,'' Ms Fort said . ''I believe that there is a distinction between the mediagenic class of artists and ordinary citizens that have a vision that is more simple .''

6,"The anxiety and anger have been building all year . In March x a national coalition of Islamic xxorganised crimees or posing a risk to national security ,'' he said .  Yet the Justice Department has in the last two years loosened some restrictions on agents' ability to start and conduct terrorism investigations . The new guidelines x which the FBI . confirmed in October in response to a suit filed by the civil rights group Muslim Advocates x make it easier to plant informers and allow agents to include ethnicity and religion in the assessment of targets x as long as those are not only factors considered .  After four members of a mosque in Newburgh x NY x were charged in May with plotting to bomb two Bronx synagogues x the authorities acknowledged that the investigation had begun with an informer who became a linchpin in the scheme . Congregation members said he had frequented the mosque x offering young men money and gifts .  The Queens imam arrested in September as investigators pursued the coffee vendor was an informer who had helped authorities . Last month x federal prosecutors moved to seize several buildings across the country that house mosques x saying they were owned by a nonprofit group with links to Iran . As a rare federal investigation that has ensnared houses of worship x the case stoked apprehensions that the government sees Arab Americans and Muslims as a people apart .  ''We are citizens who care about our country as much as everyone ,'' said Wael Mousfar x president of the Arab Muslim American Federation x a New York umbrella group . ''But people don't know what to expect x who might report them for speaking about Middle East politics x what someone might get your teenage son to do .''  His community's relations with law enforcement were rocky in the weeks after 9/11 x when the authorities began detaining hundreds of Muslim and Arab noncitizens x most of whom were cleared of links to terrorism and deported . But FBI . officials and leaders of Muslim x South Asian and Arab American groups eventually forged an understanding x maintaining communication channels .  Linda Sarsour x director of the Arab American Association of New York x a social services agency x said that even then x the connection felt tentative . She was baffled when bonds that she and other leaders established with a New York FBI . chief evaporated upon the arrival of his successor .  Experts say that complaint partly reflects high turnover .  It also attests to differing views within the bureau about the effectiveness of community outreach x said Michael Rolince x a former director of counterterrorism in the FBI .'s Washington field office . Some factions within the agency x he said x have always been leery of Islamic and Arab American xorganized by most accounts x the unraveling of ties between the FBI . and Muslim Americans began two years ago x with the FBI .'s decision to stop sharing information with the nation's most prominent Muslim civil rights xorganized by council executives' fail to xanswer questions about links with the Palestinian militant group Hamas . The executives denied any such connection x and accused the FBI . of staining the council's reputation (without) not due process .  In June x the American Civil Liberties Union made a similar complaint about Justice Department decisions to shut down six Muslim charities (without) not filing charges . The moves x which froze billions of dollars in assets x have instilled among Muslims ''a pervasive fear that they may be arrested x prosecuted x targeted for law enforcement interviews'' if they give to any Islamic charity x the ACLU said .  Imam Mohammad Shamsi Ali x chief cleric at the Islamic Cultural Center of New York x in Manhattan x said that his organization had suffered a 30 to 40 percent decline to xtravel overseas to spy on Mr Yazid x he said x agents told him to forget his pending application for permanent residence .  In February x immigration officials told Sheik Saleh that the application had been rejected because he fail to xfill in a section about ties to political groups . He contends that was a minor oversight . FBI . and immigration officials would not discuss his case .  Sheik Saleh said that he faced deportation because he resisted FBI . pressure . ''Your dignity is bigger than the green card ,'' he said .  Zein Rimawi x a pet store owner and a founder of the Al Noor School x a private school in Bay Ridge x said anxiety made people cautious about transactions with individuals and institutions x even his school x which he said was $700 ,000 in debt as a result .  Mr Rolince x the former FBI . agent x said he understood the worries x but felt they were overblown . ''The FBI . has 12 ,500 agents ,'' he said .

7,"Treasury bond prices fell nearly a point in light trading activity yesterday as securities dealers sought levels that would attract more investor demand . Although many analysts are speculating that the Federal Reserve has moved to a slightly (less) not restrictive monetary policy x their readings of the Fed's tea leaves have not enough to reduce Treasury bond yields below the 8 3/8 percent to 8 5/8 percent range that has prevailed for several weeks . Late yesterday the 8 3/4 percent Treasury bonds due in 2017 were offered at 102 7/32 x down 29/32 x to yield 8 .54 percent . In the xshort term market x hopes that the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market could fall xwell above $21 a barrel in the futures market . Other measures of inflation have been much (less) not alarming x and Alan C . Lerner x a managing director at the Bankers Trust Company x concluded that ''the worst news is probably in the past .'' Except for oil x prices of many other commodities have been stable to lower in recent weeks x alleviating the major concern mentioned by Fed officials on May 19 when they voted to adopt a slightly more restricive monetary policy . On May 19 the Commodity Research Bureau's futures price index was at 231 .21 x compared with 225 .5 yesterday . Some Offer Higher Yields Although investor demand for long term Treasury bonds was slack x a few corporations were willing to offer higher yields to attract buyers for new 30 year debentures . A $250 million offering by Chevron was offered through Merrill Lynch with a yield of 9 3/4 percent x or about 1 .23 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Colgate Palmolive offered $150 million of 9 5/8 percent debentures due in 2017 through Goldman x Sachs and Company at 9 .89 percent x or about 1 .35 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Analysts said activity in the Eurobond market remained subdued x though prices rose modestly for many issues of American companies x with investors and traders waiting for more details of the plans by the Treasury to modify its earlier proposal to eliminate a tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles . Because the Treasury's earlier proposal would make some Eurobonds subject to the American withholding tax x it touched off a flurry of plans to redeem outstanding issues and depressed prices of others . The Eurobond market is not only sector where participants are re examining their bond documents to learn what events could result in early retirement . Uncertainty on Tax Status In the tax exempt market x trading has been sharply curtailed in bonds that were originally issued in the frantic days of August 1986 and December 1985 x just before Congress imposed new limits on the amount and kinds of financing permitted in the tax exempt market . Because of reports that as many as 100 bond issues are under investigation by a United States Attorney in Philadelphia or the Securities and Exchange Commission x George D . Friedlander x a managing director at Smith Barney x Harris Upham and Company x noted in a recent research report that ''participants are refuse to xbid in size on any paper that has an unfamiliar name'' or was issued in August 1986 or December 1985 . Some issues under investigation are trading with yields of xwell over 9 percent to their first ''put ,'' or redemption x date in 1990 or 1991 x compared with about 5 1/2 percent for similar x untainted issues . Mr Friedlander said that in the case of bonds of East St Louis x Ill . x and Chester x Pa . x which are known to be under investigation x ''creditworthiness is not problem'' because trustees are holding the money raised from the bond sales . But he warned that investors were still uncertain about whether the Federal Government would challenge the tax exempt status of those bonds . If their status is challenged x it is not clear whether the bonds could be retired before their first ''put'' date in 1990 or 1991 .

4,"While a backlash emerged Tuesday among French politicians of all stripes about whether their government and others should have rushed to embrace the cause of the jailed film director Roman Polanski x his American legal team picked up an influential new member: the lawyer Reid Weingarten x a wellxknown Washington power player and close friend and associate of Attorney General Eric H . Holder Jr .  For two days x European political leaders and cultural figures from around the globe had offered public xsupport for Mr Polanski x 76 x who was arrested last weekend at Zurich's airport on a 31 year old fugitive warrant from the United States in a case involving sex with a 13 year old girl . But on Tuesday x the political mood seemed to shift .  Marc Laffineur x the xvice president of the French Assembly and a member of President Nicolas Sarkozy's ruling center right party x the Union for a Popular Movement x took issue with the French culture and foreign ministers' remarks xsupport either that his crime does not qualify for extradition x because he was originally to have been sentenced to (less) not year in prison x or that he has already effectively served his sentence x during a 42 day psychiatric evaluation .  Mr Weingarten decline to xcomment .  A former government lawyer who once worked in the Justice Department's public integrity division x Mr Weingarten is described as one of Mr Holder's closest friends x and joined him in founding the See Forever Foundation x which helps disadvantaged children .  For two days x Polanski supporters in the French film industry and news media circulated petitions and took to the airwaves . Among them were top officials in the Sarkozy administration and cultural figures like the philosopher Bernard Henri Levy x who suggested that the Swiss had more serious criminals than Mr Polanski x who x he said ''perhaps had committed a youthful error .''  By Tuesday x though x the mood was shifting . Daniel Cohn Bendit x a French deputy in the European Parliament from the Green Party x criticized Sarkozy administration officials as leaping too xxquick to support Mr Polanski . On the extreme right x the father and daughter politicians Jean Marie and Marine Le Pen also criticized the ministers x saying they were supporting ''a criminal pedophile in the name of the rights of the political artistic class .''  Marie Louise Fort x an Assembly member who has sponsored (anti) not incest legislation x said in an interview that she was shocked by the support for Mr Polanski .  ''I don't believe that public opinion is spontaneously supporting Mr Polanski at all ,'' Ms Fort said . ''I believe that there is a distinction between the mediagenic class of artists and ordinary citizens that have a vision that is more simple .''  The mood was more hostile in blogs and e mail to newspapers and news magazines . An online question in the French daily Le Figaro showed that more than 70 percent of about 30 ,000 respondents said Mr Polanski should face justice .  Still x many continued to rally to the director's defense .  Film industry leaders like Pedro Almodovar x Martin Scorsese x Costa Gavras and Woody Allen signed a petition with more than 100 names that expressed ''stupefaction'' with the arrest . But support was not universal . Luc Besson x a prominent French film director and producer x was not list x though he describes himself as a Polanski friend .  ''Our daughters are good friends ,'' Mr Besson said in a radio interview with RTL Soir . ''But there is one justice x and that should be the same for everyone .'' URL: http://www .nytimescom",0,19,
5," The nation's economy grew at an annual rate of 4dot5 percent in the fourth quarter of 1983 while inflation remained subdued x the Commerce Department reported today .  The pace of growth in the final three months of the year was (less) not half the recovery's 9dot7 percent burst last spring . But the Government called the slowdown encouraging for this year's prospects . The report nevertheless pointed to some trouble spots . High interest rates and the high valued dollar x factors that many economists attribute to Federal budget deficits x caused a sharp deterioration in the country's trade xbalance budget decicits will only make things worse x he xstress that category x spending for durable goods such as appliances and automobiles increased at a rate of 15 .4 percent . Business investment x meanwhile x has begun contributing significantly to the economy's growth x as it typically does as a recovery moves into its second year . Spending for industrial equipment of various kinds surged 22 .3 percent in the fourth quarter after rising 18 .7 percent in the third . Just a year ago x business spending was decline to xbe raised in today's report . That expectation was based in part on what then look xlike strong retail buying . Buying More Imported Goods It turned out x however x that Christmas shoppers x along with industry x were buying more imported goods than ever x contributing (less) not growth of the domestic economy than anecdotal accounts of the buying rush implied . ''Economists were confused by the strength of demand for goods ,'' Mr Ortner said . ''Some of those goods were provided by imports .''

6,"The anxiety and anger have been building all year . In March x a national coalition of Islamic xxorganised crimees or posing a risk to national security ,'' he said .  Yet the Justice Department has in the last two years loosened some restrictions on agents' ability to start and conduct terrorism investigations . The new guidelines x which the FBI . confirmed in October in response to a suit filed by the civil rights group Muslim Advocates x make it easier to plant informers and allow agents to include ethnicity and religion in the assessment of targets x as long as those are not only factors considered .  After four members of a mosque in Newburgh x NY x were charged in May with plotting to bomb two Bronx synagogues x the authorities acknowledged that the investigation had begun with an informer who became a linchpin in the scheme . Congregation members said he had frequented the mosque x offering young men money and gifts .  The Queens imam arrested in September as investigators pursued the coffee vendor was an informer who had helped authorities . Last month x federal prosecutors moved to seize several buildings across the country that house mosques x saying they were owned by a nonprofit group with links to Iran . As a rare federal investigation that has ensnared houses of worship x the case stoked apprehensions that the government sees Arab Americans and Muslims as a people apart .  ''We are citizens who care about our country as much as everyone ,'' said Wael Mousfar x president of the Arab Muslim American Federation x a New York umbrella group . ''But people don't know what to expect x who might report them for speaking about Middle East politics x what someone might get your teenage son to do .''  His community's relations with law enforcement were rocky in the weeks after 9/11 x when the authorities began detaining hundreds of Muslim and Arab noncitizens x most of whom were cleared of links to terrorism and deported . But FBI . officials and leaders of Muslim x South Asian and Arab American groups eventually forged an understanding x maintaining communication channels .  Linda Sarsour x director of the Arab American Association of New York x a social services agency x said that even then x the connection felt tentative . She was baffled when bonds that she and other leaders established with a New York FBI . chief evaporated upon the arrival of his successor .  Experts say that complaint partly reflects high turnover .  It also attests to differing views within the bureau about the effectiveness of community outreach x said Michael Rolince x a former director of counterterrorism in the FBI .'s Washington field office . Some factions within the agency x he said x have always been leery of Islamic and Arab American xorganized by most accounts x the unraveling of ties between the FBI . and Muslim Americans began two years ago x with the FBI .'s decision to stop sharing information with the nation's most prominent Muslim civil rights xorganized by council executives' fail to xanswer questions about links with the Palestinian militant group Hamas . The executives denied any such connection x and accused the FBI . of staining the council's reputation (without) not due process .  In June x the American Civil Liberties Union made a similar complaint about Justice Department decisions to shut down six Muslim charities (without) not filing charges . The moves x which froze billions of dollars in assets x have instilled among Muslims ''a pervasive fear that they may be arrested x prosecuted x targeted for law enforcement interviews'' if they give to any Islamic charity x the ACLU said .  Imam Mohammad Shamsi Ali x chief cleric at the Islamic Cultural Center of New York x in Manhattan x said that his organization had suffered a 30 to 40 percent decline to xtravel overseas to spy on Mr Yazid x he said x agents told him to forget his pending application for permanent residence .  In February x immigration officials told Sheik Saleh that the application had been rejected because he fail to xfill in a section about ties to political groups . He contends that was a minor oversight . FBI . and immigration officials would not discuss his case .  Sheik Saleh said that he faced deportation because he resisted FBI . pressure . ''Your dignity is bigger than the green card ,'' he said .  Zein Rimawi x a pet store owner and a founder of the Al Noor School x a private school in Bay Ridge x said anxiety made people cautious about transactions with individuals and institutions x even his school x which he said was $700 ,000 in debt as a result .  Mr Rolince x the former FBI . agent x said he understood the worries x but felt they were overblown . ''The FBI . has 12 ,500 agents ,'' he said . ''Believe me x there's not enough of them to waste time looking at you unless they have a good reason .'' URL: http://www .nytimescom",0,19,
7,"Treasury bond prices fell nearly a point in light trading activity yesterday as securities dealers sought levels that would attract more investor demand . Although many analysts are speculating that the Federal Reserve has moved to a slightly (less) not restrictive monetary policy x their readings of the Fed's tea leaves have not enough to reduce Treasury bond yields below the 8 3/8 percent to 8 5/8 percent range that has prevailed for several weeks . Late yesterday the 8 3/4 percent Treasury bonds due in 2017 were offered at 102 7/32 x down 29/32 x to yield 8 .54 percent . In the xshort term market x hopes that the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market could fall xwell above $21 a barrel in the futures market . Other measures of inflation have been much (less) not alarming x and Alan C . Lerner x a managing director at the Bankers Trust Company x concluded that ''the worst news is probably in the past .'' Except for oil x prices of many other commodities have been stable to lower in recent weeks x alleviating the major concern mentioned by Fed officials on May 19 when they voted to adopt a slightly more restricive monetary policy . On May 19 the Commodity Research Bureau's futures price index was at 231 .21 x compared with 225 .5 yesterday . Some Offer Higher Yields Although investor demand for long term Treasury bonds was slack x a few corporations were willing to offer higher yields to attract buyers for new 30 year debentures . A $250 million offering by Chevron was offered through Merrill Lynch with a yield of 9 3/4 percent x or about 1 .23 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Colgate Palmolive offered $150 million of 9 5/8 percent debentures due in 2017 through Goldman x Sachs and Company at 9 .89 percent x or about 1 .35 percentage points more than Treasury bonds . Analysts said activity in the Eurobond market remained subdued x though prices rose modestly for many issues of American companies x with investors and traders waiting for more details of the plans by the Treasury to modify its earlier proposal to eliminate a tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles . Because the Treasury's earlier proposal would make some Eurobonds subject to the American withholding tax x it touched off a flurry of plans to redeem outstanding issues and depressed prices of others . The Eurobond market is not only sector where participants are re examining their bond documents to learn what events could result in early retirement . Uncertainty on Tax Status In the tax exempt market x trading has been sharply curtailed in bonds that were originally issued in the frantic days of August 1986 and December 1985 x just before Congress imposed new limits on the amount and kinds of financing permitted in the tax exempt market . Because of reports that as many as 100 bond issues are under investigation by a United States Attorney in Philadelphia or the Securities and Exchange Commission x George D . Friedlander x a managing director at Smith Barney x Harris Upham and Company x noted in a recent research report that ''participants are refuse to xbid in size on any paper that has an unfamiliar name'' or was issued in August 1986 or December 1985 . Some issues under investigation are trading with yields of xwell over 9 percent to their first ''put ,'' or redemption x date in 1990 or 1991 x compared with about 5 1/2 percent for similar x untainted issues . Mr Friedlander said that in the case of bonds of East St Louis x Ill . x and Chester x Pa . x which are known to be under investigation x ''creditworthiness is not problem'' because trustees are holding the money raised from the bond sales . But he warned that investors were still uncertain about whether the Federal Government would challenge the tax exempt status of those bonds . If their status is challenged x it is not clear whether the bonds could be retired before their first ''put'' date in 1990 or 1991 .

8,When government scientists went looking for mercury contamination in fish in 291 streams around the nation x they found it in every fish they tested x the Interior Department said x even in isolated rural waterways . In a statement x the department said that some of the streams tested were affected by mining operations x which can be a source of mercury pollution x so the findings x by scientists at the United States Geological Survey x do not necessarily reflect contamination levels nationwide . But Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said the findings underlined the need to act against mercury pollution . Emissions from coal fired power plants are the largest source of mercury contamination in the United States . A quarter of the fish studied had mercury levels above safety levels set by the Environmental Protection Agency for people who eat the fish regularly x the Interior Department said .
