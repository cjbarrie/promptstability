At the last election, about a third of the nation's voters didn't even both to turn out. IT'S HARD TO THINK OF A MORE DAMNING CONDEMNATION OF POLITICS IN THIS COUNTRY. But it's not difficult to understand why so many people feel cynical and uninterested. Since the last war the Tories and Labour have each had six turns at Government.",0,19,0.8964393025379834,0.884086736106582,0.9096275460664207
92,"This review will focus particularly on savings that can be made across government - such as on pay, public sector pensions, and IT provision - credible and responsible finances and on low-priority spending. It will not reverse or undermine any of the spending commitments that we make in this manifesto. IN EDUCATION, THAT MEANS THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS THROUGH THE PUPIL PREMIUM WILL CONTINUE TO BE DELIVERED THROUGHOUT THE NEXT PARLIAMENT. Instead of ring-fencing education, we are doing better than that by bringing in new money to fund the Pupil Premium. In health, our first priority will continue to be to increase spending in some parts of the NHS by cutting waste in others.",1,19,0.8964393025379834,0.884086736106582,0.9096275460664207
93,"We will invest in the modernisation of our hospitals and tackle the backlog of repairs and maintenance. We will also launch a new programme to invest £60 million in the modernisation of Britain's cancer services, using the resources we will save by scrapping the Conservatives' tax handout on private medical insurance. WITHIN OUR OVERALL BUDGET, WE WILL TACKLE THE SHORTAGE OF INTENSIVE CARE BEDS WITH A SPECIAL PROGRAMME PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL £25 MILLION TO EXPAND THIS LIFE-SAVING SERVICE. A healthy Britain. Labour will launch a National Health Initiative to promote physical and mental health from birth to old age. This initiative will be led by the Department of Health and Community Care and by a new Cabinet committee that will cut through departmental boundaries.",0,19,0.8964393025379834,0.884086736106582,0.9096275460664207
94,When these high standards are reached we recognise and reward excellence through our Charter Mark initiative. There are now 647 Chartermarks and we will aim for more than 2000 Chartermarks by the year 2000. WE WILL REQUIRE ALL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO APPLY FOR CHARTERMARKS. The days of the bureaucratic paperchase are behind us. The future is government direct.,1,19,0.8964393025379834,0.884086736106582,0.9096275460664207
95,"Here are a few examples from the programme for the next two years: The Audit Commission will be able to publish league tables of performance including each local council and health authority so that people can compare the quality of service. We will ensure that inspection reports are published and widely available. ALL COUNCILS WILL HAVE TO RESPOND IN PUBLIC TO CRITICISM FROM AUDITORS. We will introduce a new 'Charterline' that people with questions or problems with a public service will be able to ring. We will require British Rail to tighten its targets for reliability and punctuality on all lines, and report monthly to passengers on how it is doing.",1,19,0.8964393025379834,0.884086736106582,0.9096275460664207
96,"We have made numerous proposals to that end. But we stand by our pledges to the Islanders. WE WILL NOT NEGOTIATE ON THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE FALKLANDS. The Wider World. When other countries are prepared to act in good faith, the Conservative Government has shown the will and the diplomatic skill to find solutions to age-old conflicts and misunderstandings. Our record of tackling long-standing problems in Hong Kong, Zimbabwe and Gibraltar demonstrates our determination to seek peaceful and imaginative settlements of difficult international disputes.",1,19,0.8964393025379834,0.884086736106582,0.9096275460664207
97,"We will remove these restrictions. Leasing schemes will allow large-scale investments to be financed at relatively little cost to the public sector borrowing requirement. PRIVATE FINANCE WILL ALSO BE MOBILISED FOR A HIGH-SPEED RAIL NETWORK WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY LINK EVERY REGION TO THE CHANNEL TUNNEL WITH PROPER ENVIRONMENTAL SAFEGUARDS. We will improve energy supplies. Families, commerce and industry need heat, light and power at prices they, can afford. Britain is well placed with reserves of coal, oil and gas which must be husbanded in a national energy policy to balance the needs of the present with those of the future.",1,19,0.8964393025379834,0.884086736106582,0.9096275460664207
98,"Over the next 22 months, additional resources of at least £600 million will be made available for investment in education. We will then continue steadily to increase the share of Britain's national wealth invested in education. WE WILL OFFER NURSERY EDUCATION TO THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS. BY THE END OF THE DECADE, ALL THREE AND FOUR YEAR O1DS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF NURSERY EDUCATION IF THEIR PARENTS SO WISH. Within six months, every local education authority will have to set targets for steadily increasing nursery and childcare services. Childhood Partnerships between councils, parents, schools, local businesses and community groups will help extend a wide range of childcare and nursery education services.",0,19,0.8964393025379834,0.884086736106582,0.9096275460664207
99,Education spending that was 4.7 per cent of national income in 1997 will rise to 5.5 per cent this year. We will continue to raise the share of national income devoted to education. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO RECOGNISE THE ADDITIONAL NEEDS OF DISADVANTAGED PUPILS. We will also ensure fundamental reform in the way the money is spent. Funding will be allocated on a multi-year timescale.,0,19,0.8964393025379834,0.884086736106582,0.9096275460664207
